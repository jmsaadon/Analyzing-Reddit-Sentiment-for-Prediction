      "['', \"Secure file storage is one of the vastly important challenges for modern IT. As more and more of our lives move into virtual space, the threat posed by potential unauthorized access to your files is growing. Commercial and financial information, business plans, and just personal information-today it exists almost exclusively in digital format.\\n\\nThe vast majority of platforms for secure file storage today operate on the principle of cloud storage, which carries a lot of risks. First, a centralized remote server is always a big threat, since you can't be sure of its reliable protection and lack of access by outsiders. Secondly, the need to transfer data between the cloud and the user's machine, even when the storage is decentralized, creates a potential opportunity for data interception.\\n\\nIn the Utopia project, this problem is solved radically - the application creates an Encrypted container on the user's device, and it is in this container that all confidential files are stored. The container is protected by three-level encryption on elliptic curves, which is almost impossible to crack at the current level of technology development. At the same time, neither the information nor the encryption keys ever leave the user's device, which eliminates additional risks.\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, you can trade or buy Bitcoin and Monero anonymously on Crypton exchange https://crp.is/listing\\n\\n\\nMore information\\n\\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/utopia/\\n\\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypton\\n\\nhttps://t.me/utopiachatoff\\nhttps://u.is/en/\", '', '', '']\n",

As more and more of our lives move into virtual space, the threat posed by potential unauthorized access to your files is growing. Commercial and financial information, business plans, and just personal information-today it exists almost exclusively in digital format.\\n\\nThe vast majority of platforms for secure file storage today operate on the principle of cloud storage, which carries a lot of risks. First, a centralized remote server is always a big threat, since you can't be sure of its reliable protection and lack of access by outsiders. Secondly, the need to transfer data between the cloud and the user's machine, even when the storage is decentralized, creates a potential opportunity for data interception.\\n\\nIn the Utopia project, this problem is solved radically - the application creates an Encrypted container on the user's device, and it is in this container that all confidential files are stored. The container is protected by three-level encryption on elliptic curves, which is almost impossible to crack at the current level of technology development. At the same time, neither the information nor the encryption keys ever leave the user's device, which eliminates additional risks.\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, you can trade or buy Bitcoin and Monero anonymously on Crypton exchange https://crp.is/listing\\n\\n\\nMore information\\n\\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/utopia/\\n\\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypton\\n\\nhttps://t.me/utopiachatoff\\nhttps://u.is/en/\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ' \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hoe6x1nw6o81.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5d36a8ddbbe78026e38c9b6faabe9cc07cb3ee3\\n\\nSo looking at my 1 hour ETH chart, it seems that we have broken two important resistance points between yesterday and today (red circles below).

(long story, TL;DR at bottom but I want you to read everything to understand)\\n\\nI am currently 22M with no degree and no job. I live on my friends mom's couch.\\n\\nMy story:\\n\\nIn 2018, I started learning the importance of saving and investing money from reading finance books and watching finance youtube when I was 18.\\n\\nIn 2019, when I was 19 years old, I had saved up a 3 month emergency fund and habitually put all my money into stocks every time I was paid.\\n\\nI did not spend on wants, I invested everything.\\n\\nDuring this time, my only job was doordash. I haven't worked a real employee job since I was in high school. Ever since I finished high school I've been doordashing for my main source of money.\\n\\nBy 2020 when covid first started, I had about $10,000 in stocks.\\n\\nIn March of 2020, I put $500 usd into bitcoin when it was $4500 dollars and thats when I started buying bitcoin.\\n\\nI started weekly DCA'ing in September of 2020.\\n\\nIn november of 2020 I put my entire savings and emergency fund (only about $3k) into bitcoin at once when it was around 16k.\\n\\nI also bought 2 ETH at $400 each.\\n\\nIn december of 2020, I sold all my stocks at a profit and put all of it into bitcoin.\\n\\nIn january 2021, I learned how to earn interest and use CeFi to take out loans. So I started leveraging and it changed the game.\\n\\nAll throughout 2021 I would doordash and use every single dollar I earned to buy crypto. specifically btc and eth. and I bought every single day it felt like.\\n\\nEven during the 64k peak and the 29k summer bottom I would still buy.\\n\\nIn August, I dropped out of college because I hated it, and because of that, my parents no longer allowed me to live in the house since I was no longer doing college.\\n\\nI didn't want to pay money for an apartment so I lived in my car and continued to doordash and put every single dollar I earned into crypto. A true penny pincher.\\n\\nThis was my very first time living alone and having to feed myself.\\n\\nI didn't feed myself. I ate peanut butter sandwiches everyday because I wanted to spend all my money on crypto.\\n\\nI lived in my car for 3 months. During the bounce from 29k all the way back up to 69k I lived in my car.\\n\\nAround November of 2021, I learned how to yield farm on different DeFi ecosystems and it changed the game once again just like when I learned how to use CeFi. If you know DeFi, you know that LP's can earn really high APR's. \\n\\nNow I have been living on my friends moms couch for the past 3 months.\\n\\nI haven't done anything to try and improve my life .\\n\\nI try applying for jobs everyday but I don't ever get a reply. Not even a decline reply. Just no reply.\\n\\nBut I haven't been trying that hard for a job because I have so much money that I don't feel the need to look that hard for a job.\\n\\nI know they say not to share your finances on reddit, but I am going to anyway:\\n\\nCurrently I have:\\n\\n0.7 bitcoin \\n\\n2 ethereum\\n\\nabout 6,000 CRO\\n\\nabout $5,000 in LP's (anywhere from 15%-60%) and I also have a couple hundred in a degen farm but I don't count that.\\n\\nWhen you add this up, it's about 40k in crypto and they have different interest rates on them and I reinvest the interest to have it compound\\n\\nIt fluctuates by hundreds on low volume and fluctuates by thousands on high volume.\\n\\nOver time it has fluctuated tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\nI don't doordash anymore for because 1. im too scared to leave the house.  2. on a good day I would maybe earn 100 which feels insignificant to what my portfolio fluctuates. I know this is a toxic mindset and this is not the mindset that got me to 40k in crypto, but damn the motivation to work is gone now.\\n\\nI have mad social anxiety now and I don't leave the house until my friend comes back home and wants to go somewhere. I am a mess.\\n\\nI can't even gather up the courage to get in my car and do one single doordash order anymore.\\n\\nI fear going into restaurants, I fear the idea of getting a job, I fear talking to people. what's wrong with me?\\n\\nAll I do all day is watch youtube and scroll reddit and look up the bitcoin price 10 times an hour.\\n\\nAnd the reason I'm getting more and more anxious about this is because I think I am ruining my relationship with my friend and my friends family because I'm not providing anything really.

One of the most popular in the NFT ticketing world is the [GetProtocol](https://www.get-protocol.io/), a blockchain-based engine for issuance of fully digital proofs of a rights to enter events. GET is the utility token that serves as a fuel for smart tickets issued by the GET Protocol.Currently the protocol is used by two ticketing companies: GUTS Tickets (stadium shows to large-scale dance events) and Itix (theater-focused). And since I've always been a fan of music when it comes to NFT Ticketing Marketplace for Music I‚Äôd say [Centaurify](http://www.centaurify.com/?r=1) appears to be the clear frontrunner so far. It is built on the Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Cardano networks, and it can be used to mint and distribute thousands of NFTs at a low cost. Artists also have complete control over how tickets are used and resold. In addition, they provide a link between NFT merchandise and NFT ticketing. They also just started staking the CENT token and the next two years could be really huge for them.\\n\\nNFTs have proven to be successful across a number of industries.

(long story, TL;DR at bottom but I want you to read everything to understand)\\n\\nI am currently 22M with no degree and no job. I live on my friends mom's couch.\\n\\nMy story:\\n\\nIn 2018, I started learning the importance of saving and investing money from reading finance books and watching finance youtube when I was 18.\\n\\nIn 2019, when I was 19 years old, I had saved up a 3 month emergency fund and habitually put all my money into stocks every time I was paid.\\n\\nI did not spend on wants, I invested everything.\\n\\nDuring this time, my only job was doordash. I haven't worked a real employee job since I was in high school. Ever since I finished high school I've been doordashing for my main source of money.\\n\\nBy 2020 when covid first started, I had about $10,000 in stocks.\\n\\nIn March of 2020, I put $500 usd into bitcoin when it was $4500 dollars and thats when I started buying bitcoin.\\n\\nI started weekly DCA'ing in September of 2020.\\n\\nIn november of 2020 I put my entire savings and emergency fund (only about $3k) into bitcoin at once when it was around 16k.\\n\\nI also bought 2 ETH at $400 each.\\n\\nIn december of 2020, I sold all my stocks at a profit and put all of it into bitcoin.\\n\\nIn january 2021, I learned how to earn interest and use CeFi to take out loans. So I started leveraging and it changed the game.\\n\\nAll throughout 2021 I would doordash and use every single dollar I earned to buy crypto. specifically btc and eth. and I bought every single day it felt like.\\n\\nEven during the 64k peak and the 29k summer bottom I would still buy.\\n\\nIn August, I dropped out of college because I hated it, and because of that, my parents no longer allowed me to live in the house since I was no longer doing college.\\n\\nI didn't want to pay money for an apartment so I lived in my car and continued to doordash and put every single dollar I earned into crypto. A true penny pincher.\\n\\nThis was my very first time living alone and having to feed myself.\\n\\nI didn't feed myself. I ate peanut butter sandwiches everyday because I wanted to spend all my money on crypto.\\n\\nI lived in my car for 3 months. During the bounce from 29k all the way back up to 69k I lived in my car.\\n\\nAround November of 2021, I learned how to yield farm on different DeFi ecosystems and it changed the game once again just like when I learned how to use CeFi. If you know DeFi, you know that LP's can earn really high APR's. \\n\\nNow I have been living on my friends moms couch for the past 3 months.\\n\\nI haven't done anything to try and improve my life .\\n\\nI try applying for jobs everyday but I don't ever get a reply. Not even a decline reply. Just no reply.\\n\\nBut I haven't been trying that hard for a job because I have so much money that I don't feel the need to look that hard for a job.\\n\\nI know they say not to share your finances on reddit, but I am going to anyway:\\n\\nCurrently I have:\\n\\n0.7 bitcoin \\n\\n2 ethereum\\n\\nabout 6,000 CRO\\n\\nabout $5,000 in LP's (anywhere from 15%-60%) and I also have a couple hundred in a degen farm but I don't count that.\\n\\nWhen you add this up, it's about 40k in crypto and they have different interest rates on them and I reinvest the interest to have it compound\\n\\nIt fluctuates by hundreds on low volume and fluctuates by thousands on high volume.\\n\\nOver time it has fluctuated tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\nI don't doordash anymore for because 1. im too scared to leave the house.  2. on a good day I would maybe earn 100 which feels insignificant to what my portfolio fluctuates. I know this is a toxic mindset and this is not the mindset that got me to 40k in crypto, but damn the motivation to work is gone now.\\n\\nI have mad social anxiety now and I don't leave the house until my friend comes back home and wants to go somewhere. I am a mess.\\n\\nI can't even gather up the courage to get in my car and do one single doordash order anymore.\\n\\nI fear going into restaurants, I fear the idea of getting a job, I fear talking to people. what's wrong with me?\\n\\nAll I do all day is watch youtube and scroll reddit and look up the bitcoin price 10 times an hour.\\n\\nAnd the reason I'm getting more and more anxious about this is because I think I am ruining my relationship with my friend and my friends family because I'm not providing anything really. I sit at home all day.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR: I invested all my money in crypto before and after the bull run and now I have 40k in crypto at 22 years old and it made me depressed because I no longer have a reason to get up and work because I know I have enough money to continue coasting.

One of the most popular in the NFT ticketing world is the [GetProtocol](https://www.get-protocol.io/), a blockchain-based engine for issuance of fully digital proofs of a rights to enter events. GET is the utility token that serves as a fuel for smart tickets issued by the GET Protocol.Currently the protocol is used by two ticketing companies: GUTS Tickets (stadium shows to large-scale dance events) and Itix (theater-focused). And since I've always been a fan of music when it comes to NFT Ticketing Marketplace for Music I‚Äôd say [Centaurify](http://www.centaurify.com/?r=1) appears to be the clear frontrunner so far. It is built on the Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Cardano networks, and it can be used to mint and distribute thousands of NFTs at a low cost. Artists also have complete control over how tickets are used and resold. In addition, they provide a link between NFT merchandise and NFT ticketing. They also just started staking the CENT token and the next two years could be really huge for them.\\n\\nNFTs have proven to be successful across a number of industries. From gaming to high-end luxury fashion, NFT use cases have demonstrated the importance of creating lasting connections between a company or a brand and its users/customers. NFTs could also be a way for the different industries to boost revenues that have been lost since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\", 'An acquaintance introduced me to LME Company digital currency exchange platform.
