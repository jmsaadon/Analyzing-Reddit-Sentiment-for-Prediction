2022-04-18 18:40:57,u6k87q,You haven‚Äôt gotten to know eth until you‚Äôve staked it on DeFi,"With the move that eth is going for on the new update, it will be switching from proof of work to proof of stake, taking the power and ability to mine away from just anyone with a pc, to a select few with copious amount of Ethereum, and this is why you should be paying attention. 

To be able to mine, more people will ask to hold you eth, just that their stake increases. This is why eth staking is so big and getting even bigger. Especially on DeFi platforms that give out fair payouts to their users for it. Places like Lycan will ask to hold you eth and you will receive a high apy for it, even though you aren‚Äôt doing any labor in it. 

Yes, I understand that centralized exchanges will ask you to stake as well. And they might be using it for the same reason, however, how could you trust an exchange owned only by a few people? 

Keep you trust in DeFi and let‚Äôs keep this running. If you happen to lose out your money on a centralized platform, you have no one to blame but yourself. 

Yes, stakin eth is safe. If the platform has a reputation and a name to it already. That could be your security and insurance. That‚Äôs what will keep you safe.",10,0

2022-04-18 14:23:46,u6ed35,Has anyone bought icETH? Why did you choose it over other yield options?,"Hi, I'm a community member at Index Coop. Index Coop (IC) is a decentralized and autonomous asset manager that provides a range of products allowing crypto investment in a simple and efficient way. icETH is the most recently introduced among IC's products.

The Interest Compounding ETH Index (icETH) provides enhanced yield on Ethereum (ETH) by using Lido's Liquid Staked Ethereum (stETH) as collateral to recursively borrow Wrapped Ethereum (wETH) through Aave to procure more stETH. All of this is abstracted away into a single token. With icETH, holders retain spot exposure to ETH plus amplified staking rewards.

icETH was launched just two weeks ago and already has over 10M in AUM according to Dune Analytics. Since this marks one of Index Coop's most successful launches to date, I'm gathering feedback on why this was the case and how we can do even better next time. Please feel free to not only describe why you chose icETH, but also why you didn't if that's the case: any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated too. Thank you for reading.",0,0

All of us are waiting for these big changes which were expected in June. The aim is to cut traffic congestion on the network and reduce high transaction fees, which would be a significant development in the world of cryptocurrencies. Because of all these difficulties and issues, we started to use all these L2 platforms, Metis, or something similar since we need a solution.  


Because Ethereum is the dominant network for ""smart contracts"" and DeFi, I believe this delay is extremely problematic. It serves as the foundation for a variety of crypto trading and lending activities. It is also extensively used as the foundation for  NFTs, and tokens that attempt to function similarly to digital dollars with a set value. Delays in the upgrade might jeopardize the ETH supremacy.  


Ethereum merge may now be delayed until the fall, so we will see how will things develop at the time.

NBA to Release 2022 Playoffs Ethereum NFT Collection. The NBA is stepping up its NFT and Web3 efforts following the success of NBA Top Shot, and is targeting Ethereum.

As part of this initiative, the NBA has created a Discord server , which already has over 30,000 members, and this afternoon announced its plans to launch NFTs on Ethereum related to the current season's playoffs, which start tomorrow.

While Dapper Labs' NBA Top Shot is one of the biggest NFT projects to date, helping to establish the concept of digital sports collectibles and propelling NFTs into the mainstream, it now appears that the professional basketball league is planning expand into other NFT and Web3 initiatives, including a collection of Ethereum NFTs based on this season's playoffs.

""To give a clue, we are working on the [development of the NFT](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) project to celebrate the NBA playoffs,"" reads the announcement. ""We are not ready to announce the details yet, that will come soon.""

The post explains that the first 10,000 members of the server will be able to add an Ethereum wallet address to an allow list before 5pm ET on Saturday, and those who make it to the cutoff will be ""guaranteed access to mint an NFT from this project."" Minting of NFTs will be free, excluding gas fees from the Ethereum network.

Since this new project is built on top of Ethereum, Dapper Labs and NBA Top Shot are unlikely to be directly involved. NBA Top Shot is built on Flow, Dapper's own blockchain platform, which it built to handle high-volume NFT projects after facing the limitations of [Ethereum development ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development)with the first NFT project, CryptoKitties.

Decrypt contacted Dapper Labs to clarify any involvement in this new NBA initiative, but did not receive an immediate response.

According to the NBA Discord server, this new NBAxNFT initiative is not focused on any NFT releases, but rather on a variety of potential projects in the Web3 space.

""This Discord server is the official NBA home for basketball and Web3 fans to engage, interact and learn more about current and future NBA projects and partnerships,"" it says. ad. ""It's not limited to just one NFT project. It's a space for this community to connect on things they're passionate about.""

An NFT works like a receipt backed by blockchain technology, proving ownership of an item. They are often used for digital items such as artwork, sports collectibles, and video game items. The broader NFT market generated a transaction volume of $25 billion in 2021 alone.

The NBA recently filed a trademark application in the United States for a trademark called ""The Association,"" which would encompass a variety of [development of NFT-](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development)related initiatives ranging from collectibles to game tickets and merchandise.",4,0
2022-04-18 06:00:54,u663dp,Environmental implications of the consensus method change in Ethereum,"Switching from proof of work to proof of stake would mean reducing the carbon footprint, among other things.

Currently, the [**Ethereum network**](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) **and other blockchains, such as the Bitcoin network itself , operate using the proof of work (PoW) consensus that demands computing power** to solve the new blocks that are added to the chain. When bitcoin began to operate on its own network, the decision seemed logical, since it was possible to mine blocks with a laptop without difficulty, but eventually **the power needed to solve the blocks rose so much** that it has been a long time since it has only been possible to mine those blocks with **specialized devices such as ASICs** . Today, the need to change the consensus mechanism is more pressing due to several factors, such as the **carbon footprint** .

[Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) is the second most used network in the blockchain sector and **its innovation was the introduction of** ***smart contracts*** . This network also operates in PoW but the arrival of version 2.0 of the network has long been expected to replace this consensus mechanism with the **proof of stake (PoS)** mechanism , in which it is possible to validate the blocks based on the coins that are *staked* . In this format , not so much computing **power is needed to validate the blocks.**

However, due to the revaluation of ether in recent years **, the cost of transactions has risen greatly and it is not uncommon to have to pay tens of dollars** to send an NFT to another wallet or to validate any DeFi transaction as you can . be a swap between tokens or a deposit. This undoubtedly reduces the benefits of operations and has motivated many users to try **other blockchains with lower gas costs** , such as BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.

In relation to the environment, the reduced use of IT equipment to validate blocks with the PoS consensus provides a more responsible way of using the energy resources destined for mining with a much smaller carbon footprint. Energy consumption cannot be reduced to zero, but it is possible to greatly optimize the energy consumption of the equipment. Ultimately, **the security of the network will be enhanced by the change of consensus** as validators who do not do a good job will lose coins in the form of penalties.

In addition, **with the coming of the Metaverse, many users are eagerly awaiting version 2.0 of Ethereum** to take advantage of the updated network. Although there is still **no confirmed date** for its publication, it is expected that it will not take too long and the community will benefit from the new features of this *blockchain* .",0,0

2022-04-17 19:23:05,u5u5mx,Is Staking Crypto A First Step to Your First Million?,"When you first start in the crypto industry, it can be overwhelming because of the many different coins and ways to make money. It is easy to get frustrated with bad investments and trading. However, to confidently earn income, you should consider cryptocurrencies that have indeed proven resilient.

Even if you missed out on the early rise, it‚Äôs not too late to make money on crypto today. Armed with staking features, we‚Äôve got some really good earning opportunities here. What‚Äôs more, staking and time are the main weapons of a passive crypto investor. In a nutshell, this is all it takes to become wealthier one day.

**What are the rewards?**

The final rate of return is determined by the choice of the coin, the staking period, and the type of staking. In most cases, payments are 6‚Äì15% per annum of the amount of assets on the account. The best I‚Äôve seen were 20-23% APYs on [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) platform. 

You can also find some insane rates in DeFi space, such as 200-300%, which I've never tried (do not inspire confidence in me).

Let‚Äôs say you decide to start making crypto with crypto and finally make more crypto with a more amount of crypto. The action process is simple here: the interest in the form of crypto, accrued on the invested capital, increases the starting size of your investments at the beginning of the next period, and hence the amount of future income. Add the potential growth in the value of the cryptocurrency itself, and you get the most result that crypto investors could ever dream of.

**Dream big**

Your desired million-dollar mark will depend on your initial investment, monthly replenishment, and the period.

Let‚Äôs take an example.

\- You were lucky, and you did everything as correctly as possible. You invested $5,000 to buy 1000 N tokens when the price was at the dip. The staking rate ‚Äî 15%. Let‚Äôs say a bull market started, and you kept investing 700 N tokens every month whatever the price was. This wonderful scenario has lasted for 2 years. Once again, you predicted the end of the bull market and decided to stop just before the bear market began.

So what is the result?

\- After performing mathematical calculations and assuming that the price of your cryptocurrency has increased 10 times during the bull market, you get the coveted million!

Still don‚Äôt believe?

\- Well, when it comes to compound interest and bull market opportunities, everything is possible. By initially buying 1000 N tokens and replenishing 700 N tokens monthly, you accumulate about 20,099 N tokens over 2 years. With all those conditions mentioned, the total value of your assets will be around $1,005,000.

**There is no guarantee**

Having a clear understanding of the risks of cryptocurrencies themselves and their volatility, it is worth asking the question: ‚ÄúAre there any risks for cryptocurrency staking?‚Äù. Staking can provide promising profits, however, it can also lead to some notable setbacks that you should take into account before staking a cryptocurrency. Here are some risks you may find:

* **Liquidity**. There is no guarantee that you can convert crypto assets back to cash or other coins, as this depends on supply and demand.
* **Lock-up period**. There is no guarantee that your lock-up period will end before the price falls.
* **Loss or theft**. There is no guarantee that your funds won‚Äôt be stolen or lost because of fraud or project failure.
* **Staking interest rate**. There is no guarantee that the staking interest rate won‚Äôt change.",6,0

2022-04-17 18:15:28,u5sslk,Do you think ETH will be used on a daily basis in the near future?,"I started thinking about what we might buy with ETH because there are so many projects and businesses that now accept this sort of payment. Above all, Ethereum was created with the goal of emphasizing smart contracts and decentralized, self-executing agreements that are embedded in the network itself.  


All of these potential benefits are available with ETH, and I've seen that an increasing number of businesses are currently accepting ETH payments. Consider NFTs: we may purchase all of these tokens with ETH and use them to pay for other services provided by other projects and marketplaces, such as SK8coin or any other that accepts ETH.  


I must state that I did not use ETH to pay for anything directly. When we look at this more closely, we can see that we are already utilizing ETH to pay for a variety of products, even when we omit the tokens we buy for future payments.

What you may not know, is that Russians have billions in crypto. This has surged post the Ukraine-Russia war, as Russians began to fear losing the value in their local currency (which they did). This was also occurring in Ukraine, where people even began selling and buying things with crypto, such as cars and food. And as a result programs that endorse direct crypto payments like Binance Pay and Exeno were grown ever so popular. People began downloading methods and way to pay through with ways other than fiat or credit cards, and it worked. 

Publicity is publicity, and crypto grows in both good and bad. If the bill were to pose as a mediator with severe crypto regulations on mining and cryptocurrency payments, it will make people even more attracted to crypto as a rebellion from that system. If it were to promote crypto, people will be encouraged to use it to connect back to the world outside as much as possible. 

There is no way for crypto to go but up. People have realized its power, and it‚Äôs hard to go back from this.",22,0
2022-04-17 06:53:37,u5hg33,"Don‚Äôt sell your eth just yet, hold in out until the next update","The next update is so near, yet I still know people in real life who are selling to pay off things. This is one of the worst things you could do, and profits should be used to make more profits. 

I‚Äôm not against selling profits. But you should be using profits to buy real things only. Like what you can do with sites like exeno or Binance pay, the former offering you a broad range of products directly and the latter giving you confidence in reputation. Never sell your profit and hold it in cash. 

Cash dies out. And it is already. Look what inflation is doing to the world, does that not scare you? 

Instead, most cryptocurrencies employ deflation, and holding makes you only more powerful rather than less. Markets are not diluted, they are ever more concentrated, as demand goes up ÿû and supply goes down. Crypto has learned from our economies, and made their structure better. Credit is not a good system. In crypto, what you see is what you get. 

Don‚Äôt sell and regret it later, sell what you need and hold what you can. Fiat won‚Äôt be here for long, do not ride a sinking ship until it drowns.

2022-04-16 22:24:55,u58sse,The most underrated investing skill is the ability to do nothing 99% of the time.,"¬†If you get good at this (surprising hard skill), your long term returns will likely thank you.

What do I mean by this? When the market‚Äôs doing its thing (going up and down), sometimes it‚Äôs hard to stay on the rollercoaster. But those who get on and off regularly statistically miss out on the majority of the Crypto market‚Äôs returns.

It‚Äôs a hard skill to learn because while the market is plummeting, the natural instinct is to exit, but statistically, the best thing to do is hold on and buy more.

2022-04-16 22:17:52,u58nov,"Increasing your income will speed up your journey to financial freedom. You can only cut your expenses down so much, but you can increase your income exponentially over time. The critical part: once you‚Äôve increased your income, maintain or marginally increase your expenses.","Frugality is excellent, but frugality alone will only get you so far.

If you want to reach financial independence well before you turn 65, you‚Äôll need a high income.

However, a high income alone will not get you there faster.

What matters is the gap between income and expenses.

This gap is what builds wealth, not solely your income or expenses.

Build that gap up by either increasing your income, decreasing your expenses and invest the difference in high-quality assets. Your future self will thank you.

Note: wealth isn‚Äôt everything. It‚Äôs all about balance. You don‚Äôt want to sacrifice your mental health (at least not for long) to increase your income or decrease your expenses. Find a happy medium. In fact, even if you are trying to maximise wealth, this may be the best strategy because it‚Äôs the most sustainable over a long period.",1,0
2022-04-16 21:34:19,u57s87,Ethereum's Importance," After reading several articals I think that Ethereum has been adopted by the crypto community and industry as the chain of choice for most blockchain-based decentralized apps"" (DApps). 

 I believe that Ethereum and its compatible networks clearly outweigh all others in terms of the number of DAOs. According to Snapshot, a blockchain voting platform, there are over 4,200 DAOs and protocols that require governance members, which I found fascinating.  

From my point of view another indicator of ETH's importance and value is the fact that Ethereum drives about 95% of the NFT ecosystem, so it's no wonder that when investors seek for an NFT marketplace, OpenSea, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, and others come to mind. 

To keep up with all of the new collections minted on the ETH blockchain, we need to employ search engines like LUDO or equivalent that look like Google for NFTs.  

In terms of tools for founding and maintaining all aspects of DAOs, especially financial but not exclusively, Ethereum is the most established ecosystem. As other chains gain prominence, this may alter. ""How do you feel about the importance of ETH?",1,0

2022-04-16 21:12:23,u57ce4,ETH has the potential for growth this year!,"The much-anticipated Ethereum merge, which was supposed to happen before June 2022, has been postponed. Even before the merge, a $10 billion bet has been placed on the autonomously-run Defi platform Lido Finance for the Ethereum network overhaul.  


According to the latest news, roughly 3.22 million tokens have been put on the Lido finance protocol in the hopes of completing the Ethereum integration successfully.  


The announcement of the Merge's postponement, on the other hand, hasn't had a negative influence on Ethereum thus far. As things stand now, ETH is expected to continue to rise over the next three months. Given the economy's and liquidity's problems, the rise is likely to be turbulent.  


Ethereum is trading downward on a 7-day chart. ETH was selling for over $3200 just seven days ago, but it is today trading for less than that. ETH, on the other hand, has not fallen below $3000 in the previous seven days, despite the market being in turbulence.  


For ETH, the previous 24 hours have been a period of recovery. However, because the rebound has been limited, ETH has failed to break beyond $3100. One of the key reasons for this is that the trading volume for ETH has been steadily decreasing over the previous 48 hours.  


ETH has lost over 20% of its value since January 2022, whereas BTC has lost 15% of its value since January 1st 2022.  


What's your opinion on these numbers, is this the time for investing in giants like BTC or ETH, or investing in small projects such as crayon?",2,0

I know that with the new update Ethereum will see it will be witnessing a lot less stress on the network and in turn, a lot less waste of power from mining that is going on unregulated. And I know that this has been grounds for argument for the longest time, and that crypto has held its anti-environment title for too long, which is why we need to work to change things. 

If you were to actually check the data and run the numbers, you‚Äôd see that they might have a point. Bitcoin and crypto in general are very polluting and something should be done about it. I know that there are many projects going around like Plastiks that throws accountability into the mix by making sure that every user is responsible for proper disposal of single-use plastics, and that the new eth update will be turning things around, but most importantly, we have to commit to change for it to happen. 

It‚Äôs been going around one time too many that we make promises and not deliver, let‚Äôs make this one count. We only have one nature, so let‚Äôs take care of it.

2022-04-16 06:04:31,u4rdy6,Environmental Implications of Consensus Method Change in Ethereum,"Switching from proof of work to proof of stake would mean reducing the carbon footprint, among other things

Currently, the [development of Ethereum network](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) and other blockchains, such as the Bitcoin network itself, operate using the proof of work (PoW) consensus that demands computing power to solve the new blocks that are added to the chain. When bitcoin began to operate on its own network, the decision seemed logical, since it was possible to mine blocks with a laptop without difficulty, but eventually the power needed to solve the blocks rose so much that it has been a long time since it has only been possible to mine those blocks with specialized devices such as ASICs. Today, the need to change the consensus mechanism is more pressing due to several factors, such as the carbon footprint.

[Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) is the second most used network in the blockchain sector and its innovation was the introduction of smart contracts. This network also operates in PoW but the arrival of version 2.0 of the network has been expected for a long time, which will replace this consensus mechanism with the proof of stake (PoS), in which it is possible to validate the blocks based on the coins that are staked. In this format, not so much computing power is needed to validate the blocks.

However, due to the revaluation of ether in recent years, the cost of transactions has risen greatly and it is not uncommon to have to pay tens of dollars to send an NFT to another wallet or to validate any DeFi transaction as you can. be a swap between tokens or a deposit. This undoubtedly reduces the benefits of operations and has motivated many users to try other blockchains with lower gas costs, such as BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.

In relation to the environment, the reduced use of IT equipment to validate blocks with the PoS consensus provides a more responsible way of using the energy resources destined for mining with a much smaller carbon footprint. Energy consumption cannot be reduced to zero, but it is possible to greatly optimize the energy consumption of the equipment. Ultimately, the security of the network will be enhanced by the change of consensus as validators who do not do a good job will lose coins in the form of penalties.

In addition, with the coming of the Metaverse, many users are eagerly awaiting version 2.0 of[ Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) to take advantage of the updated network. Although there is still no confirmed date for its publication, it is expected that it will not take too long and the community will benefit from the new features of this blockchain.",2,0

If gas reaches that level, it alerts and vibrates your mobile phone

1.Auto transactions when gas fee conditions are met.
2. Better UI

Why is this still relevant? You could literally mint NFTs for free on Polygon and bridge them to Ethereum. And USDC payments only Polygon cost fractions of a penny as well.

I don‚Äôt know about other scaling solutions cause I‚Äôve only used Polygon for now and I‚Äôm satisfied for now, but I assume that anything is better than using the Ethereum mainnet.

And yeah I get that that there will always be that type of person that doesn‚Äôt use anything but Ethereum. But these are a very small minority cause I bet you that 99% of people reading this use an L2 or some sort of scaling solution.

So yeah, kinda weird how I still see these posts and tweets. An brief explanation would actually be interesting.",0,0

# Portus Network

**Portus** is an open, trustless, permissionless API oracle. It is both an Inbound Oracle and an Outbound Oracle with features designed to ensure information validity and action traceability:

* `Open` because it is built from open-source software and made available as open-source software for full transparency
* `Trustless` because the network allows participants to interact publicly or privately without requiring a trusted 3rd party.
* `Permissionless` because anyone can participate without authorization from a governing body. This is valid for both consumers and providers.

# Why Portus Network?

* Democratize the Data Oracle market: `anybody can become a Data Provider`
* Replace validators with decentralized insurance and arbitration
* Engage the community through delegated staking insurance pools
* Reduce complexity and hurdles: stateless node, no validators, no quadratic communication
* Significantly lower fees, only the gas fees of every integrated blockchain to be paid
* `Bring all kind of external data` in the blockchain, not only numbers: unlimited possibilities, Portus Network enables numerous functionalities of smart contracts
* User friendly API Gateway that `connects` smart contracts with any event from the real world

>**Monero‚Äôs obfuscated ledger has enabled a number of exchanges to misrepresent their reserves, and sell XMR that they don‚Äôt actually have, knowing that all too many of us will never withdraw, and no one can see onchain the evidence of their misdeeds.**  
>  
>**April 18th. We‚Äôre withdrawing XMR from exchanges. Any exchange that hasn‚Äôt disabled withdraws (which many of them have already), we‚Äôre pulling our funds.** 

Unfortunately, XMR is not the only coin with this issue. CoinBase has been creating notes for ETH and LRC among many other cryptocurrencies (if not all) and does not actually hold them in reserve...

For the CEX who have not disabled XMR withdraws, I am very excited to see the effects of Monerun on 4/18.

I wonder if Ethereum should have a similar movement since most CEX do not hold Ethereum as a reserve also... is this right for CEX to do or is it plain shady?

 The future of finance is decentralized. It‚Äôs an idea that seems so obvious in hindsight, but it wasn‚Äôt until the last few years that we‚Äôve begun to see the speed at which this future is coming to fruition. We‚Äôre not just talking about crypto exchanges or blockchain-based financial services; we‚Äôre talking about a fundamental rethinking of the way money works, with a focus on open-source code and permissionless networks. üî•

ApeX is a decentralized, permissionless, and non-custodial platform that allows for the creation of perpetual swap (funding) markets on any token pair. Perpetual swaps are derivative contracts that allow two counterparties to conduct a margin trade, where settlement does not occur until one party terminates the contract. 

The successful launch of the beta version of the protocol on Arbitrum mainnet, seed round fundraising, and its soldout 4,580 unique NFTs, have brought an eventful beginning for ApeX. üëç

As for donuts, the r/ethtrader banner which is the main deflationary mechanism for donuts is pretty much not doing anything at this price, donut Inflation is 25.6%

We need to find a solution for the dropping price either by providing an incentive for people not to sell the donuts or make them deflationary.

Currently governance, premium membership and r/ethtrader banner are the only real use cases for donuts and most people don't use or care about these.

Show us your best ideas, we can make a governance proposal and make donuts better for everyone.

2022-04-14 19:12:09,u3oxyv,"Ethereum price targets $10,000 despite merge delays","After recovering from the recent crypto market massacre, the price of Ethereum may rise as is BTC, $BNB and $Crayon. The introduction of the altcoin's consensus layer, as well as the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, has been put back to Q3 2022. 

The Ethereum merger has been postponed until Q3 2022. 
As Ethereum transitions from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, the Merge is a much-anticipated event among Ethereum holders. The Ethereum development team renamed the update ""consensus layer"" instead than ""ETH2"" in January 2022.

An Ethereum core engineer, Tim Bieko, verified that the protocol's anticipated switch to Proof-of-Stake is set for Q3 2022. While the cause for the delay is unknown, Bieko acknowledged that this is the ""last chapter of Proof-of-Work."" 

According to Parit Hosh, a Validator Whisperer at the Ethereum Foundation, the final testnet phase might span three months. The testnet's early completion is critical for the mainnet's introduction of the consensus layer. 

Proponents believe the much-anticipated event will have a beneficial impact on the price of Ethereum. The Ethereum Triple Halving thesis, which anticipates a surge in ETH price comparable to three and a half Bitcoin halvings, was motivated by the inclusion of burn with the EIP-1559 protocol.

After a sharp drop in price over the previous week, FXStreet analysts assessed the Ethereum price trend. The Ethereum price has a swath of support extending from $2,800 to $3,000. 

According to analysts, Ethereum's slide below the high volume node around $3,300 is a bearish indicator, and the altcoin may remain stationary.",36,0

Bear markets will make you rich, you just have to understand how to use them. Stray away from fear, and especially don‚Äôt overleverage. Split your buys over a number of stops, and hold on until you are in profit. Take command and keep fear to the sidelines. 

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with taking profits when you get them. In fact, use your profits to buy things. Real products.

[ Patronize a Star sky cards  ](https://preview.redd.it/5sxdu28j0jt81.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1eb5f68e7998e576b4dd0bea3f8a76d4d167fe42)

After the war started not too far from his borders and after looking at the long list of recent and ongoing wars on the planet in general, he realized we are too crowded or too fixated on our planet. We fight and growl like in a small closed group tired of each other. 

   One of the easiest remedies for a brewing conflict in a pab/bar is just to take a pause and have a walk before one gets too much into it. Similarly for us as humankind, a good thing to do is to get our minds beyond our planet and indulge into research of endless territory we have just 60 miles above our heads. 

   Such an approach helped to end the cold war between the Soviet Union and the U.S. The whole confrontation gradually turned into a peaceful space race as a series of competitions between the Soviet Union and the United States: who would be the first to launch an orbiting spacecraft, a piloted spacecraft, a space crew, a Moon rocket, a space station‚Ä¶ Flights were scheduled to preempt media publicity from the competition. Temporary victory veered from one bloc to the other, with each claiming ‚Äî or at least implying ‚Äî that being momentarily ahead in the race was proof of the superiority of its political and economic system, just as Olympic gold medals were (and are) risibly interpreted as markers of national quality. That worked then and can work now. 

   There are no right and wrong in a conflict, everyone wants to achieve their own goals. Attracting attention to peaceful space exploration rather than exaggerating the current conflicts would dissolve disputes and get the whole humankind to the new level of progress. 

So he founded the Patronize a Star NFT campaign

The campaign has two goals: 

* Shift government and society attention to peaceful space exploration, and 
* Fund better and faster space research.

That‚Äôs why the campaign was brought about.

Currently there are three phases of the campaign:

1. First is the 12 NFTs airdrop. The purpose is to get the first holders and spread the word about the campaign 
2. If you are late for airdrop, the next step is the presale for as little as 0.02 Eth. There is no plan to have such a low price in the future. 
3. Other NFTs of the campaign are presented at Rarible and Opensea at the full price. 

   When you as a contributor buy one of those NFT, the main part of your contribution goes to charity. But that is not all. The project has developed an innovative approach to the sphere of charity allowing contributors to get a possible profit. While it would not be appropriate to sell a trophy or a plaque one got for a contribution in the real world, it does not derogate the contributor in the NFT world. The first contributor is minted into the blockchain forever as the first owner. However that contributor can resale his/her NFT further to collectors who would be interested to collect the whole constellation or to get a particular star they feel a relation to. So in Patronize a Star campaign the holders are welcome to resale their NFTs in which case the creator fee of 10% goes to charity. So the whole system can help holders to resale with a profit as well as to contribute to peaceful space exploration again with that resale.

   The collection is going to be of 10 000 items, approximately 120 brightest stars for each of 88 constellations. Since it takes time to generate sky chart NFTs with geospatial software, only one of constellations has been released so far with the first 120 stars. 36 of those were pre-minted for open markets. Those are the brightest stars of the Aquila Constellation. Find them on Rarible and Opensea. The next 12 are reserved for the airdrop. And then next 36 reserved for the first 0.02 Eth presale.

   The whitelisting for the airdrop and the presale is done through a great service Premint.xyz. No verification is required. The actual minting process is provided by great service Factoria.app.

It appears trustworthy, however, as I've heard today, the shift to proof-of-stake may not happen until the fall.  


All these years it was hard dealing with expensive gas fees, slow transactions, and all these issues that come along with ETH, I remember that I  tried a lot of L2 platforms, but I figured it out that Metis really does the best job for me, so I'm sticking with it.  But I must admit that I was excited about the news when I heard the first time of Ethereum merge, so it was quite disappointing to hear that they decided to delay the merge.  


Ethereum‚Äôs move to PoS, where users reserve the ability to secure the network by ‚Äústaking‚Äù ether, is expected to cut the network's energy costs by 99% and make it easier for Ethereum to scale. They say that the signs are promising that the Ethereum mainnet will actually merge with the beacon chain to become a Proof-of-Stake network this year.  


What I've found in one article as an explanation is: ""Central to these latter stages are the trial runs of public test nets such as Kiln, and the roll out of shadow forks which enable devs to test various merge/PoS-related implementations on the network. Another important factor is the difficulty bomb (an automated increase in mining difficulty designed to make PoW mining less attractive), which Beiko says will start to be noticeable on Ethereum around May and make blocks unbearably slow by August.‚Äù",7,0

2022-04-14 04:05:25,u38okl,Ethereum developer jailed for 5 years for violating North Korea sanctions,"Virgil Griffiths, the former developer of Ethereum has been sentenced to 63 months in prison and will pay a $100,000 fine for attending a conference and helping North Korea use blockchain technology in violation of US economic sanctions. US District Judge Kevin Castell of the Southern District (TADAWUL:3050) in New York issued the decision on Tuesday. Judge Castell stated that ‚Äúwhat you see here is a deliberate intent to violate the penalties system,‚Äù adding that the crime was exacerbated because Griffiths had ‚Äúa desire to educate people on how to evade penalties.‚Äù In September 2021, Griffiths pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that prohibits US citizens from exporting any ""goods, services, or technology to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) without authorization from the Treasury's office"". Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)"". In early 2019, Griffiths failed to obtain permission from US authorities to travel to North Korea. But in April, he went anyway and visited the capital of Pyongyang for a Blockchain and Cryptocurrency conference. At the conference, he gave presentations in a North Korean suit on how the country uses digital currencies to evade sanctions and money laundering. He also provided methods on how to use smart contracts to the benefit of the country in nuclear arms negotiations with the United States. In an effort to mitigate his sentence, Griffith's defense team provided evidence of factors that may have caused him to act irrationally. They provided a psychiatric evaluation for Griffiths, which showed that he suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). Obsession with North Korea His defense team said a diagnosis of obsessive personality disorder and NPD explains Griffiths' ""obsession"" with North Korea and likely ignored warnings from his friends, family and government about unauthorized travel into the country. At the hearing, Griffiths was given the opportunity to speak, saying he regretted his actions adding that sanctions imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine ""showed their value"" and that he was ""cured"" of his ""obsession with"" North Korea. The court did not appear convinced that Griffiths was remorseful, with Judge Castell saying: ""The fact of the matter is that Virgil Griffiths hoped to come home as a hero in crypto to be admired and praised for standing up to government sanctions, for his courage and nobility."" Griffiths was arrested in November 2019 by the FBI a few months after he returned from the conference. He held several meetings with the office regarding his trip before his arrest and even provided them with photos of him giving presentations at the conference. North Korea has become increasingly sophisticated with its use of digital currencies to evade sanctions and use hacks and exploitation to steal millions of dollars. In January, a report by Chainalysis revealed that North Korean hackers stole nearly $400 million in 2021 through crypto-exchange and ransomware hacks using a micro-laundering system that includes decentralized exchange swaps and various crypto tools.",6,0

Southeast Asia to become the ""Hub for the Metaverse.""","Inspired by fictional events, historical stories, and different myths, ""LOST in Metaverse"" will host a series of immersive adventure games, LOST, the Hong Kong-based company announced.

The company, further said that players would be able to earn tokens and limited-edition NFTs while playing the game.

""The whole concept of LOST in Metaverse is to create a play-to-learn, play-to-earn experience where players can form teams with friends online and solve mysteries together in the comfort of their homes,"" Rick Woo, Founder of LOST, said.

LOST isn‚Äôt the only Southeast Asian player eyeing up the Metaverse, however.
In another significant development, HSBC Holdings said that it had established a fund to render investment opportunities to its high and ultra-high net worth investors in Singapore and Hong Kong.

HSBC will pinpoint investment opportunities across five areas in the metaverse ecosystem; infrastructure, interface, computing, experience and discovery, and virtualization through the Metaverse Discretionary Strategy portfolio.

As mainstream companies are increasingly warming up to NFTs and the Metaverse, projects associated with its ecosystem are expected to see more institutional money flow in. Protocols that boast sound fundamentals, such as Quint, a project that offers tailor-made NFTs designed by artists with an inherent eye for luxury; Sandbox, a virtual universe where players can buy and sell digital land; and Theta, a decentralized streaming protocol that revolutionizes web3 video rendering, are expected to see a mammoth surge in institutional interest.

Lina Lim, Asia Pacific's regional head of discretionary and funds for investments and wealth solutions at HSBC, stated:
""The metaverse ecosystem, while still at its early stage, is rapidly evolving. We see many exciting opportunities in this space as companies of different backgrounds and sizes are flocking into the ecosystem.""

With a multitude of global firms entering the Metaverse ecosystem, the virtual space is poised to shoot up high in Q2!",21,0
2022-04-13 18:18:40,u2wq6s,"Trading is harder than it sounds, I‚Äôve been here for years and barely made a profit","My little cousin who literally just got started in the market just randomly started buying random things in the Metaverse like suku and mana and he‚Äôs already turned a bigger profit than I have in the last year. Am I a bad trader or is it just luck? 

I always felt a little intimidated when it comes to trading. I would always be the first to sell and the last to buy, I misunderstood market patterns, and I would often stay out of the market completely even when everything is going green. I know I have some things to work on, but I also know that I‚Äôm not alone. I know there are a lot of people like me, who have not made that much money in trading at all. 

I really believe that trading is not for everyone. There are people who can just get up and start doing it, and there are people who will do it for many years without turning a profit. It‚Äôs a really selective kind of job and there‚Äôs always a chance that it‚Äôs not for you. 

If you are a good trader and have seen many successful trades in your lifetime, then good on you. In fact, I‚Äôd appreciate some pointers too. But if you are like me, you might want to stay out of the bear market lest you lose it all.

Well, I believe that for the most part people are scared and confused. I wouldn‚Äôt really blame them, though I would advise these people move out of their comfort zone and do something better. It‚Äôs natural to feel afraid and alarmed during a bear market, I assure you that even the most venerated trader still does, but it‚Äôs unnatural to let your fears consume you. Breathe, think and hold. 

Better yet, what I really suggest is just doing something else completely. Don‚Äôt sit around in fear and think about the worst. What you can do is use all the time you are not trading eth to research new projects in the market. Are you paying attention to what‚Äôs happening in the Metaverse? And how so many brands and names are making collabs with suku to enter? You can never know what you‚Äôre missing unless you look it up. 

Hold your eth tokens boys. Good times are coming.

2022-04-13 15:35:19,u2t25v,What is Trader Joe? Everything You Need to Know,"The JOE platform was founded in June 2021 by its pseudonymous creators 0xMurloc and CryptoFish. It was born out of the desire to create a unique and innovative trading platform on top of Avalanche‚Äôs superior-tech, paving the way on the cutting edge of the decentralized frontier. Its core values are to be a one stop shop DeFi experience, to build a lean and agile team, to never compromise on safety, and to always innovate. It also incorporates a community-first approach and prioritizes accessibility and freedom for all.

## Trader Joe

Trader Joe is a Decentralized Exchange, Lending Platform, and DeFi token Launchpad based on the Avalanche blockchain. As one of the first projects to launch on Avalanche, Trader Joe has cemented itself as a bluechip of the Avalanche ecosystem, and is considered the main exchange on the blockchain, boasting over $1.4 Billion in value locked in its liquidity pools. In order to incentivize investors to provide liquidity to the DEX, Trader Joe offers rewards in the form of JOE token. There are dozens of farming opportunities available on Trader Joe, with APRs ranging up into the triple digits.

## Trader Joe Tokenomics

Users of Trader Joe are able to utilize the JOE token in a number of ways. There are three versions of ‚Äústaked‚Äù JOE that comprise what Trader Joe calls its ‚Äúmodular staking‚Äù model. These are rJOE, sJOE, and veJOE. 

**rJOE** is ‚ÄúRocket Joe‚Äù. Staking JOE tokens in the rJOE module unlocks the ability for users to participate in the Rocket Joe Liquidity Launch platform (the launch platform described above). It‚Äôs important to note that projects participating in Rocket Joe are exclusive to Trader Joe ‚Äì making it impossible to bypass rJOE staking. 

**sJOE** is a revenue share that allows stakers to earn stablecoins. Instead of staking JOE to earn more JOE, as is the case with most staking models, sJOE provides a hedging opportunity for more risk adverse traders. The stables paid to sJOE stakers are generated from trading fees on the DEX. 

**veJOE** is the governance token of the Trader Joe platform. Though governance features have not yet been launched, veJOE will govern the platform in the future. veJOE also provides stakers with boosted farming yields. The more veJOE you accrue, the higher your JOE yield in farms will be. Locking the maximum amount of JOE can provide up to 67% higher yields (1.67x the advertised APR)! 

Too complicated? That‚Äôs ok! Start staking your JOE easily [here](https://midas.investments/assets?sid=216893).

The Trader Joe platform is indeed a one stop shop for DeFi users, packaged together with a friendly, fun, and colorful branding. Its unique tokenomic model ensures sustainability without sacrificing profitability, and it is built on the solid foundation of the Avalanche blockchain.

2022-04-13 10:56:11,u2nmjv,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Slip to Three-Week Lows! BTC is trading below $41k!","Bitcoin and Ethereum, the industry‚Äôs two largest cryptocurrencies, are both down to almost three-week lows.

The crypto market's hopes for a reinvigorated Bitcoin (BTC) rally during last week‚Äôs Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami failed to live up to expectations; the leading cryptocurrency has slipped below $41,000. 

The rest of the crypto market has followed suit, with the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH) down 5% for the day, currently changing hands below $3,100.

Arthur Hayes, the CEO of BitMex admitted that both BTC and ETH are ‚Äúhighly correlated‚Äù to the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 (NDX) stock market index, which is down 3.87% since last Tuesday.

‚ÄúIf the NDX tanks, it will take crypto down with it,‚Äù commented Hayes.

However, when the global sentiment shifts, fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies will be the quickest to recover. Nature's Vault, a project that uses blockchain technology to unlock the value of mineral assets without causing environmental damage; Terra, a decentralized blockchain payment platform for stablecoins; and Chainlink, a protocol that allows smart contracts to securely connect to external APIs and payment systems, may exceptionally grow in market cap once the major cryptos regain key levels.

""It's only a matter of time,"" Hayes points out.
Even the most trending cryptocurrency projects, LUNA and AVAX, are down 8.17% and 7.39% respectively. The current dip is an opportunity to seize to achieve a better ROI!",13,0

Ethereum developers implemented the network's first ""shadow fork"" on Monday, marking a major milestone in the current migration to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus.

The shadow fork provides a space for developers to test their assumptions about the network's complex switch to PoS, according to Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh Jayanthi. ‚ÄúThe goal of the Kiln testnet was to allow the community to practice running their nodes, deploying contracts, testing infrastructure, etc.‚Äù , he tweeted on Sunday.

Kiln is referring to the latest testnet of the so-called merger, which involves transitioning [Ethereum](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)'s execution layer from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). In a blog post on March 14, the Ethereum Foundation described the merger as a ‚Äúculmination of six years of research and development‚Äù with the intention of making the network more secure and energy efficient.

Ethereum Foundation developer Marius van der Wijden confirmed on Monday that PoS testing was underway. ‚ÄúToday will be the first shadow fork of the mainnet. We are approximately 690 blocks (\~2hrs) away from TTD,‚Äù he tweeted.

The positive developments surrounding the merger have fueled an increasingly bullish narrative for Ethereum, one that allowed the price of ETH to temporarily  break a months-long downtrend. While ETH and the broader crypto market are pulling back in a new bout of risk aversion , the prospect of earning passive rewards on the [Ethereum network development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) has attracted considerable interest from investors.

The amount of ETH staked on Ethereum's Beacon Chain is fast approaching 10.9 billion, with a current average balance of 33.5 ETH, according to industry data. Beacon Chain currently has over 340,000 validators, which is a 13% gain since early March, when the 300,000th validator was first registered .",1,0

I know there‚Äôs reason to be afraid, but this amount of panic is unjustified. Yes, crypto is crashing, but I mean, most of us here have been through much, much worse, so why would you be afraid? 

Truth is, crypto has always been highly affected by world news. News change the price this is a fact. And the reality is that there is a lot of turmoil and negative news around the markets that there isn‚Äôt anything to keep the prices up. 

The only sector still going up today is the Metaverse and everything related to it, and yeah maybe that‚Äôs a statement of their strength, but maybe because the world is evolving. I mean we‚Äôve already seen so many brands like McLaren partnered with infintite by suku to enter the Metaverse along with Gucci and Roblox, and I‚Äôm starting to see a pattern here. The mass corporations of the world believe in the Metaverse and this is fact. 

For the rest of us, might be best to just hold and wait, as we have done, and as we should do. In the meantime maybe start researching other projects and other names that perk your interest.

2022-04-12 18:58:18,u26kfw,What does Ethereum mean to you?,"I came upon an intriguing essay that discusses Ethereum, and it's extremely beneficial whether you're a rookie or not."" The Ethereum network is often referred to as the Web3 foundation layer, despite the fact that its native currency, ETH, has no defined definition.    


The second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, has gone a long way since its beginnings, and it is extremely essential since it drives nearly all of the NFT ecosystem. To keep up with all of these new collections, we'll need to employ LUDO or similar NFT search engines that look like Google.

I admire how David Hoffman, co-host of Bankless, tried to explain ETH in terms of the present monetary system.When ETH is staked, he claims, it becomes a capital asset since it generates revenue and can thus be valued based on expected returns, much like bonds.

When ETH is used as a transaction payment mechanism, it functions as a consumable asset, similar to how US dollars are used to pay taxes. Finally, holders can use ETH as a store of wealth by depositing it into DeFi protocols

.The Ethereum ecosystem is built on this definition. It demonstrates the multiple factors that influence the price of ETH while also paving the door for wider adoption and growth. It also shows how ETH may be compared to important assets in traditional economies. The Ethereum ecosystem, for example, can recognize the US economy's trinity of US currencies, US government bonds, and IRS taxes.

So, what are your thoughts on Ethereum, and what is your definition of it?",9,0
