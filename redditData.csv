2022-05-26 19:54:05,uyfzit,Why is the metaverse important?,"The Metaverse, as a key digital invention of the twenty-first century, holds a lot of potentials. We've seen so many things that are currently developing or are going to, there are numerous plans for this project which seem promising.  


Have you seen how many people have begun to purchase virtual land? That is why we have an expanding number of metaverse platforms, we may soon acquire land on Aurora 42 and other such platforms, it's no longer about 4 main resellers (Sandbox, Decentraland, CryptoVoxels, and Somnium Space), this number started to increase as well.   


The Metaverse strives to give a new worldview articulated through the following challenges:  


For the first time, the actual and virtual worlds are linked.  
Interconnecting everyone, regardless of geographical boundaries or borders.  
Getting rid of cognitive biases, anxiety, shyness, and psychological barriers.  
Proposing a hedonistic view of the world, suited to epicurean personalities, for whom everything is ultimately feasible.  


So, what do you think, are you in? Do you like the idea?   


Why do I believe in this idea? The reason for this is that the metaverse will surely generate opportunities for new sorts of business models that we haven't even considered yet. What is your reason?",0,0

2022-05-26 19:30:54,uyfhbd,Is there any advice for average computer users? Do you use any of these privacy protections?,"For public blockchains that allow smart contracts, blockchain privacy is a big problem. Many individuals have begun to use this technology to protect their data and privacy, which I fully endorse after learning about all of its advantages on the Modex website the other day.  


A substantial amount of money and other items are at stake. So, if you want to keep your bitcoin assets private, consider using a blockchain solution. I'm considering it; at first, I thought Modex would be fantastic, but as I've discovered, it's better for companies.  


Is there any advice for average computer users? Do you use any of these privacy protections?  


Since these programs and tools are becoming more popular, some people, even if they have worked with cryptocurrencies for a long time, believe they should not be used. Do you know how simple it is to connect people through transactions?  


Given the absence of names in the transactions, it is feasible to connect people. For example, the more often an address appears, the simpler it is to associate it with a certain individual.

Of course, none of this is about money, there are other reasons for this.  


Many female NFT artists are using their NFTs to make the crypto, web3, blockchain, and NFT worlds more diverse and inclusive. There's a visible gender disparity in crypto, with more males than women. Male artists represent 77% of NFT art sales, while female artists represent only 5%.  


There are some great women-led NFT projects such as  World of Women NFT, Boss Beauties, No More, WomenRise, etc.  


Do you know maybe some great women-led NFT projects?  


I believe this is only the beginning of what is to come in the NFT business, as these empowering and motivating women and girls highlight the numerous advantages of learning about NFTs, web 3.0, the blockchain, and crypto.

Since the launch of NFT games, playing video games has provided a unique experience by offering substantial value to players' activities or characters in video games, the blockchain has made them worthwhile to play.

I did some research on these MMORPG NFT games and was curious about your opinions on them:

[The Summoner](https://thesummoner.io/) : The Summoner is a free MMORPG play-to-earn (P2E) game on the Polygon network where users battle world bosses, conquer different levels, and participate in the PVP Arena with other Summoners, which I found out about a few weeks ago. Players can use in-game currency to upgrade Summoner creatures, buy mystery boxes, or convert to real money in the Summoner economy. Summoner provides seasonal in-game activities as well as a first-in-P2E NFT put option for profitable play-to-earn chances. It is supported by BIFROST's multichain technology. 

[SolChicks](https://www.solchicks.io/) : SolChicks is a fantasy Play-to-Earn game based on the SolChick NFT collectibles, in which players utilize their SolChicks as characters in another gaming universe. It is a game that will undoubtedly acquire popularity. This project is one of the most intriguing at the time, thanks to its well-designed environment, amazing graphics, and gameplay. The only thing that can irritate gamers is that the game is not available for free.

[Sidus](https://sidusheroes.com/#:~:text=SIDUS%20transports%20players%20to%20a,race%20they%20were%20born%20into.) : This is on the ethereum blockchain and it brings players to a universe built on crypto and blockchain philosophy, where a significant technological shift has occurred. In SIDUS, all living things have merged with technology. Each NFT can be turned into a gaming character, allowing users to embark on a journey of space exploration, power struggles, and never-ending warfare. $SIDUS Token (Gaming token) Staking - Players can stake their NFTs in exchange for NFTS payments. SIDUS has three stake levels: Original, Rare, and Legendary. By locking their NFT tokens, users can farm NTFS tokens (s).

I would love to know about the experiences you have had on these games and also recommend any games that are promising!!!!",194,0
2022-05-26 15:59:07,uyaube,When was the last time you used crypto to buy something ?,"So do any of you use crypto to buy stuff, I mean cryptos are currency  but people treat them more as stocks than currency as they usually just trade them or buy them on exchanges like Durafi and Binance rather than buying stuff with them although more and more companies are making it possible to do so. I personally can't remember when was the last time I purchased something with crypto.  


It is understandable of course people that have BTC or ETH don't want to 'deplete' their crypto, and people that have altcoins are  waiting for the right moment hoping that their value will increase overtime.  


We all heard the stories from the early days of BTC when people bought pizzas with it, and nobody I guess wants to be the guy giving the interview to a local newspaper in 5 years from now, on how he used 20 coins that are now worth 50k to buy himself a double cheeseburger with extra large fries.

2022-05-26 13:06:18,uy77sy,The Value of Tokenized Real Estate Will Largely Depend on Who is Managing the Portfolio.,"Tokenization turns real estate into a fully liquid crypto asset. Properties are held in standalone corporations whose shares are represented by Asset Tokens. By owning the Asset Tokens, you become a legal shareholder of the asset. Asset Tokens are collateralized by the value of the underlying real estate asset, allowing investors to benefit from real estate appreciation over time. Tokenization of real estate allows you to go through the entire process of owning a stake in property from KYC to purchasing all in a few minutes. A tokenization system links the original data to a token but does not provide any way to decipher the token and reveal the original data. As with any system, security tokens are not flawless. Thief, lost, inability to access and the list continues depending on who you speak with. 

In the US there are just over 11 RE projects on blockchain, however, a few are attempting to lead the charge, and more are preparing to join in. In years past real estate token companies have been called out as a scam, but with more reputable firms getting into the arena that has been changing. I found a couple of companies in the space that have piqued my interest.

**Landshare.io** \- Asset Tokens are tradeable against a BUSD pair on a Decentralized Exchange. They offer a tokenized house flip, allowing for lump sum returns on a house renovation. Also allows 3rd parties to sell tokenized assets on the Landshare platform.

**USPC.io -** USPC will be a security token based on physical assets (holding $400m of luxury real estate). Their sponsor Primior Inc. has enough assets on hand to securitize tokens and collateralize the raise. USPC intends to be the first SEC-regulated security token pegged to the value of income producing real estate. They haven't launched yet but their waitlist is now open.

**NYCREC.io** \-  NYCREC is tokenizing the New York City real estate space by offering fractional interest in acquired properties and paying token holders in Ethereum dividends. Token holders would be periodically benefited from the dividends reaped through their profit. Token holders can enjoy some of the benefits that come with owning real estate.

There are others coming and the line is getting longer. I think their success will be largely determined by who is behind the project, experienced players in the real estate industry, and not just a board filled with Wallstreet traders.",140,0
2022-05-26 12:56:02,uy70ee,"I'd rather cope with high gas prices and other Ethereum difficulties than accept Solana to be the ""Ethereum killer""","What are your thoughts on the forecast that Solana will face off against Ethereum? That was a comment made by Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, that I read about a few days ago.  


I'm aware that it's a bad time to say anything like that because the Ethereum community is furious over their platform further delaying the Merge. We've all been looking for all sorts of solutions for cheaper gas prices over the years, and I know from personal experience how frustrating it can be until you discover the correct one, which in my case is Metis.  


People referred to Solana as the ""Ethereum killer"" when it was first introduced.  


It rose to prominence as a reactive blockchain that filled gaps in the Ethereum blockchain. With a transaction pace of around 60000 per second, Solana is one of the fastest layer-one blockchains. It is a far more efficient, highly scalable, and low-fee blockchain that is currently in its early stages.  


In comparison, Ethereum not only has a larger NFT marketplace than Solana, but it is also the flagship altcoin and the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It stands out in terms of decentralization and is backed by the extremely efficient Ethereum Foundation. It enables multi-chain networks, which dramatically enhances scalability while maintaining security.  


The blockchain will launch its hard split known as the Merge this year. Many members of the Ethereum community are optimistic about it. Do you believe Solana can compete with Ethereum?",7,0

2022-05-26 12:09:38,uy65to,Circle Asks US Fed Not to Step on Its Toes by Launching a Digital Dollar,"Circle Internet Financial is arguing that the U.S. Federal Reserve should pass on launching its own digital dollar, arguing that it could strangle private-sector efforts such as Circle’s to manage their own dollar-based tokens.
And Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, said in a comment letter to the Fed that its token is already meeting “many of the potential benefits” of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the U.S.

“A host of companies, including Circle, have leveraged blockchain technology to support trillions of dollars of economic activity with fiat-referenced stablecoins,” the company told the Fed in a letter released Wednesday, meant to respond to the Fed’s invitation to comment on a January report. “The introduction of a CBDC by the Federal Reserve could have a chilling effect on new innovations.”

The stablecoin industry has been suffering collateral damage recently from the ugly collapse of TerraUSD (UST), though that was an algorithmic stablecoin, not one backed by reserves. Boston-based Circle made a case to the Fed that its stablecoin – which ranks second by global market cap – is backed by “cash and short-duration U.S. government obligations” and the company assures the public regularly with attestations about the content of those reserves.
“USDC does not detract from, but in fact supports, the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency,” the company argued.

Circle also underlined potential harms a digital dollar might pose to traditional banking, which the banking industry itself pointed out in its own letters. The stablecoin issuer left the Fed with a remark that’s a common refrain among technology-intensive industries:
“It could be challenging for the Federal Reserve to issue a CBDC on a technology standard that does not quickly become obsolete, given the pace of technological advancements,” Circle argued in its letter, which added that the company does support a comprehensive regulatory structure for crypto in the U.S.
Fed officials have routinely said the U.S. central bank doesn’t intend to move forward on a CBDC without backing from the White House and Congress.",1,0
