2022-04-01 19:58:57,ttzyl3,Turning 50€ of monthly spendings into a monthly crypto DCA with the Plutus Crypto Card,"**WHAT IS PLUTUS**

PLUTUS is a project on the Ethereum Blockchain that offers a non custodial platform with a crypto card. Due to its non custodial nature you run no risk of losing funds and are in full control of your holdings at all times, no lock ups and no trickery. You connect your account to Metamask and thats it, easy. I personally connected via Metamask with my Ledger.

**DUE DILLIGENCE**

Before i delve into the Rewards i thought a DD is of order. My opinion is very biased im a holder as well as a believer of this project.

***MarketCap:*** The low market cap is a double edged sword. A project of this low MC has a high risk ratio but at the same time this means high reward once the project succeeds.

***Long Term Survival:*** With rewards 2.0 PLUTUS as a project and company will be having a monthly revenue stream that is sustainable. The tokenomics of PLUTUS have been developed with the usecase in mind and a long term outlook.

***Non Custodial:*** Hodl your PLU safely on your own wallet of choice. This also means that if the code of PLUTUS has a bug and is hackable your own funds are safe and the impact on the project will be minimised (price wise) as staking does not take place in a centralised manner.

***Availability:*** The product (crypto card) is only available in Europe and the UK at the moment. During a recent AMA there were talks about expansions into South America next and the rest of the world.

***User Interface:*** PLUTUS has both a desktop version and an App. I use both, but i find the desktop version a bit messy, as in you sometimes have to look quite some time to find something. On the app it is much simpler and the UI is improved.

***REWARDS 2.0***

The new Rewards are a fantastic way to DCA money that you would otherwise just spend and never see again. Let me explain.

When utilizing this programme you get 20 perks to choose from:

10€ Rebate per month (or rebate in the base subscription fee) for any of the following :

&#x200B;

[The number of perks you can choose depends on the subscription you choose and whether you stake PLU or not.](https://preview.redd.it/ihw3wrei3zq81.png?width=2297&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a44eb4f00c28d94d23626d8fbba6afb1392fff0)

**Subscriptions**: 

[3 Monthly subscriptions to choose from, this is mandatory](https://preview.redd.it/gcahuvyj3zq81.png?width=2023&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c400ff403d7a3f0caa6fe3a71b7f4461604aef)

With subscription alone you can reach the following maximum earnings per category:

**1)Starter,** 3% cashback on up to 250€/mo spend  so 7.5€ a month cashback & 1 perk of choice.

***Max earnings 17.5€***

**2) Everyday,** 3% on up to 2000€/mo so 60€ a month cashback & 2 perks of choice.

***Max earnings 80€***

**3) Premium,** 3% on up to 22,500€ so 675€ a month cashback. 3 perks of choice.

***Max earning 750€***

&#x200B;

Furthermore we have **Staking requirements**, this is optional

[Note: the cashback &#37; from perks is not added to the subscription but it replaces the standard 3&#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/e0glr2am3zq81.png?width=2071&format=png&auto=webp&s=abf4dd145b01cd79643abd458413eef619dd692d)

So how do i make more than 50€ a month in cashbacks?

Currently im getting cashback from Netflix, my go to supermarkets Aldi and Lidl as well as justeats where i order food once or twice a month.

I havent changed my habits i simply added PLUTUS to my life, with an ""everyday"" subscription and the initial staking level called "" Hero"" . 

Now i automatically DCA between  40€ a month due to the 4 perks and my cashbacks can go up to 80€ if i spend the full amount of 2000€

Certainly 50€ a month is retrieved from thin air per month and automatically invested.

My friends and I recently started [Finsheet](https://finsheet.io/), which provides financial data for spreadsheet users.

We have real-time and historical price for Eth in many leading crypto brokers. For example, these functions would return real-time price of Eth on Binance and Coinbase:

* FS\_Latest(""BINANCE:ETHUSDT"")
* FS\_Latest(""COINBASE:ETH-USD"")

These 2 functions would return intra-day (1 hour) price of Eth from the beginning of today (04/01/22) until now:

* =FS\_CryptoCandles( ""BINANCE:ETHUSDT"" , ""60"" , ""04/01/2022"")
* =FS\_CryptoCandles( ""COINBASE:ETH-USD"" , ""60"" , ""04/01/2022"")

Me: I accumulate dollar bills from work, and with those dollars, I do not buy wants. I buy needs that will help me survive. The money that is not spent on needs is INVESTED into bitcoin.

I do not invest this money for the sake of having a big number in an account, and I think this is what my friends think my goal is. To have a big number in an account.

This is not true.

My ultimate pursuit is to have complete freedom to do whatever I want with my time. I achieve this by saving and investing. By having a ""big number in a bank account"" it ensures that I do not have to work if I don't want to. The ""big number in a bank account"" is what allows work to be an OPTION as opposed to being a necessity.

My friends: They accumulate dollar bills from work, and with those dollars, they spend all of it on wants.

They operate under the assumption of: ""I'm just going to swipe my card and hope it gets accepted"" and ""I spend money now because I know it will eventually come back"" but there's no plan to back up this way of thinking other than ""hope"". They ""hope"" the money will come back but haven't formulated a plan to get said money back.

These friends also: always work all week because thats the only way they can afford their lavish lifestyle of eating out at dressing in new clothes. They get a check and think ""what can I buy with this check"" instead of ""I'm going to spend 50% of this check and invest the rest"".

Bottom line: my friends spend all their money on materialistic items, and they get this money from their paycheck every two weeks. At the end of the week, they complain that they are ""broke"" and they have to wait until next paycheck to purchase what they want.

The reason they chase money is to buy material possessions, but I'm the greedy one?

What constitutes greed?

Is the pursuit of money in order to buy material possessions greed?

Is the pursuit of money in order to maintain freedom of time greed?

Is the pursuit of money for the sake of pursuing money greed?

Am I considered greedy because I have a lot of money while having very little physical possessions?

Am I considered greedy because I don't spend my money?

Am I considered greedy because I have money, period?

Am I considered greedy because I have money while my peers do not have any money?

Am I greedy? Or have I successfully set myself up for the long term?",1,0

4/1/2022

Staking offers crypto holders a way of putting their digital assets to work and earning passive income without needing to sell them.

&#x200B;

[To date, I've earned 3.45 ETH. At 3.68&#37; APR, I will earn 0.01 ETH daily. GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/f2rzgdnuhyq81.jpg?width=1128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2c428a2a82582e15a1448195e09c80c0a74780b)

You can think of staking as the crypto equivalent of putting money in a high-yield savings account. When you deposit funds in a savings account, the bank takes that money and typically lends it out to others. In return for locking up that money with the bank, you receive a portion of the interest earned from lending – albeit a very very low portion.

Similarly, when you stake your digital assets, you lock up the coins in order to participate in running the blockchain and maintaining its security. In exchange for that, you earn rewards calculated in percentage yields. These returns are typically much higher than any interest rate offered by banks.

Staking has become a popular way to make a profit in crypto without trading coins. As of April 2022, the total value of cryptocurrencies staked exceeded the $280 billion threshold, according to Staking Rewards.

&#x200B;

[1-year All-ETH portfolio. Stack, Stake and HODL \(5 years minimum time horizon\) to Richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/0ij5oxuvhyq81.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=565d5fb1c0c5d1c938a200b4780857a2a3f5b331)

How does staking work?

Staking is only possible via the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is a specific method used by certain blockchains to select honest participants and verify new blocks of data being added to the network.

By forcing these network participants – known as validators or “stakers” – to purchase and lock away a certain amount of tokens, it makes it unattractive to act dishonestly in the network. If the blockchain was corrupted in any way through malicious activity, the native token associated with it would likely plummet in price, and the perpetrator(s) would stand to lose money.

The stake, then, is the validator’s “skin in the game” to ensure they act honestly and for the good of the network. In exchange for their commitment, validators receive rewards denominated in the native cryptocurrency. The bigger their stake, the higher chance they have to propose a new block and collect the rewards. After all, the more skin in the game, the more likely you are to be an honest participant.

The stake does not have to consist exclusively of one person’s coins. Most of the time, validators run a staking pool and raise funds from a group of token holders through delegation (acting on behalf of others) – lowering the barrier to entry for more users to participate in staking. Any holder can participate in the staking process by delegating their coins to stake pool operators who do all the heavy lifting involved with validating transactions on the blockchain.

6 Top Cryptocurrencies You Can Stake: An In-Depth Guide

To keep validators in check, they can be penalized if they commit minor breaches such as going offline for extended periods of time and can even be suspended from the consensus process and have their funds removed. The latter is known as “slashing” and, while rare, has happened across a number of blockchains, including Polkadot and Ethereum.

Every blockchain has its own set of rules for validators. For example, the Terra network capped the maximum number of validators at 130. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (formerly known as Ethereum 2.0) requires each validator to stake at least 32 ether, which is worth more than $100,000 at press time.

What cryptocurrencies you can stake

As mentioned already, staking is only possible with cryptocurrencies linked to blockchains that use the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

The most notable cryptocurrencies you can stake include:

Ethereum (ETH).

Cardano (ADA).

Solana (SOL).

Luna (LUNA).

Avalanche (AVAX).

Polkadot (DOT).

Ethereum is in a peculiar situation right now because it’s possible to both “mine” and “stake”.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently transitioning from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain system, meaning that both types of validation processes are functioning concurrently.

Eventually, however, ether mining will be completely phased out as the latter more energy-efficient system takes over.

How can you start staking

To begin staking you first have to own digital assets that can be staked. If you’ve already bought some, you’ll need to transfer the coins from the exchange or app you bought them on to an account that allows staking.

Most of the bigger crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken, offer staking opportunities in-house on their platform, which is a convenient way to put your coins to work.

If you are looking for a way to maximize rewards, there are platforms that specialize in finding the highest interest rates for your digital assets. Examples of these staking-as-a-service platforms include:

EverStake.

BlockDaemon.

Figment.

MyContainer.

It’s worth noting that any coins you delegate to a staking pool are still in your possession. You can always withdraw your staked assets, but there’s usually a waiting time (days or weeks) specific to each blockchain to do so.

It is also possible to become a validator and run your own staking pool. However, this needs much more attention, expertise and investment to do successfully. Not to mention, to become a validator on certain blockchains you’ll need to source sufficient funds from delegate stakers before you can even start.

Risks of staking crypto

As with every type of investing, especially in crypto, there are risks you need to consider.

Cryptocurrencies are volatile. Drops in price can easily outweigh the rewards you earn. Staking is optimal for those who plan to hold their asset for the long term regardless of the price swings.

Some coins require a minimum lock-up period while you cannot withdraw your assets from staking.

If you decide to withdraw your assets from a staking pool, there is a specific waiting period for each blockchain before getting your coins back.

There is a counterparty risk of the staking pool operator. If the validator doesn’t do its job properly and gets penalized, you might miss out on rewards

Staking pools can be hacked, resulting in a total loss of staked funds. And since the assets are not protected by insurance, it means there’s little to no hope of compensation.

How profitable is staking

Staking is a good option for investors interested in generating yields on their long-term investments and aren’t bothered about short-term fluctuations in price.

According to data, the average staking reward rate of the top 261 staked assets surpasses 11% annual yield. It’s important to note, though, that rewards can change over time.

Fees also affect rewards. Staking pools deduct fees from the rewards for their work, which affects overall percentage yields. This varies greatly from pool to pool, and blockchain to blockchain.

You can maximize rewards by choosing a staking pool with low commission fees and a promising track record of validating lots of blocks. The latter also minimizes the risk of the pool getting penalized or suspended from the validation process.

2022-04-01 16:34:00,ttv21p,A Guide on how to keep your crypto safe,"Disclaimer- I am not a security expert or even a computer geek. The suggestions I am telling are purely something I personally use or have read about them. It is not an exhaustive list so please comment if I have left something.

1. Get a password manager- Even if your password is complex it is impossible to remember too many different complex passwords for all your accounts. It is always good to have different passwords for every account and a password manager does that. You have to just remember one password to unlock it.

**KeePassXC** it my pick.It is a free and open source password manager but the best think is it doesn't store your credentials online unlike most password managers. Another good option is **Bit Warden**.

2) Enable Two-Factor Authentication- This is a must and if you haven't done it for god's sake do it asap.There are some options but my favorite is- **Aegis**. **Authy** is also a good option. P.S if you are using Google Authenticator get a backup because when you will switch device it would be hard to restore the app.

3) Cold Wallet- You might be fed up by now by listening Not your keys not your coins but the reailty is most CEX are shady af. Also the peace of mind when you have your crypto in cold wallet is underrated.Get **Ledger** if you have a lot of Alts and **Tezor** if you just have BTC/ETH

Besides this always be aware of the sites you connect your cold/hot wallet and disconnect them after your usage. Also be aware of not sharing your portfolio information on social media platforms.",1,0

2022-04-01 14:50:57,ttsk4u,"ETH has broken out of bearish Market Structure. Do not take profits! I repeat, DO NOT FRIGGING TAKE PROFITS!","I feel the need to dump some of my thoughts. It's clear that a lot of people who own ETH don't understand what they hold, and act just based on speculation about market cycles. 

The reality is that even $10k ETH is nothing. The current breakout is just a cherry on top of something much larger.

2022 will be the year of Ethereum. Mark my words. Its adoption as technology will take off in a real way. By implementing Shard Chains this year, Ethereum is going to change the world. 

And when ETH 2.0 is fully deployed, the network will go from processing over a dozen transactions per second to nearly 100,000. That's like a 10,000x speed increase. You're smart enough to know whether this will make more developers, institutions, governments, and even just regular people want to use what the Ethereum network offers.

Another reason why not to take profits is Ethereum's role in NFTs. They are an enormous part of the future. NFTs will be used in the Metaverse for claiming ownership of real estate, and to solve many other problems. Also, several NFT projects have exceptional use cases. For example, Plastiks uses a smart contract approach to help companies become plastic neutral, Axie Infinity offers a play-to-earn model, Sandbox lets you go into a digital world where you can buy virtual plots of land, and Tezos allows developers to deploy smart contracts and execute peer-to-peer transactions. These NFT projects have a very lucrative scope!

Imagine buying a ticket to travel somewhere exotic and later getting an NFT as a souvenir from the country's tourism department. That's incredibly cool stuff. This is the future we are about to live in, and it's coming sooner than you can imagine.

Just wanted to vent and inform you all. Don't take profits. Not even at $5K. ETH is the future. Just stake it, and ride the ride.",0,0

So, will ETH Lead The Next Bull Run?","As per recent data, ETH volumes appeared to be converging with those in its larger peer, BTC. As it is anticipated to shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, ETH has seen a huge spike in interest this year.

Trading at about $3400, ETH price has surged over a staggering 20% in the past two weeks, close to breaking even with the year's high. Daily volumes have also steadily risen.

Also, the price of BTC has shot up to 2022 highs this week, as the largest cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $47,000. However, while volumes increased, they were significantly lower than the enormous amounts of liquidity seen in 2021. Still, BTC commands over 40% of total crypto market capitalization.

With that, in the latest crypto rally, altcoins have massively outperformed BTC and gained record highs in market capitalization. A similar situation was observed during the beginning of the 2021 rally, which had eventually challenged BTC’s dominance.

And so the question is: will ETH lead the coming Bull Run? And with a booming ETH, will there be NFT-season again? Projects that have an NFT marketplace with practical use cases like Plastiks (which focuses on a Recycling Recovery system that drives accountability and traceability through the plastic supply chain), Theta (focuses on decentralized video streaming), Axie Infinity (NFT-based online video game known for in-game economy) and related projects could see humongous rallies.

The EU plans to extend rules from traditional payments which obligates the validation of collected information for transactions over EUR 1,000 (US$1,107).

The proposal faced industry pushback, including from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who said the move “eviscerates all of the EU’s work to be a global leader in privacy law and policy.”

2022-04-01 09:46:45,ttmves,Cardano and Ethereum networks could join through Milkomeda,"The new EVM-based sidechain within the Cardano ecosystem

Milkomeda aims to help blockchains that do not have the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a virtual machine that allows interaction with the [development of the Ethereum network](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) and its programming language for smart contracts, Solidity.

This is done by inserting EVM-based sidechains and new technologies that can make these blockchains work as if they are compatible with the ETH token network. By opening up a wider range of networks, the protocol aims to offer “ *an experience for both developers and general users* ”.

Milkomeda will be the backbone for achieving and sustaining mass adoption of promising non-EVM cryptocurrencies, empowering them with smart contract -enabled sidechains . Milkomeda will power L1 chains with alternative smart contract virtual machines, meaning developers from other ecosystems have a seamless onboarding experience that improves adoption while leveraging the strengths of the L1 chain.

The C1 sidechain is an EVM-based sidechain within the [development of the Cardano ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/cardano-ada-blockchain-development)ecosystem , and is powered by the Milkomeda protocol. The C1 sidechain will use wADA (Wrapped ADA) as its base currency, meaning users will have the opportunity to use their preferred cryptocurrency within all EVM-based dApps running on C1. On the other hand, MilkADA will be used as an asset within its own chain for the payment of commissions and gas . To access the sidechain it will be necessary to have funds in ADA in a Cardano wallet compatible with the browser, and also the MetaMask extension.

At the time of Milkomeda's launch, on March 28, 2022, Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IOG congratulated the team behind the development:

Congratulations to the entire DCSpark team! It is a great time for Cardano. The ecosystem now supports EVM. Solidity developers, to code

Milkomeda will not only bring inter-blockchain connections to Cardano, but also to other major networks such as Algorand (ALGO), Terra (LUNA), and Solana (SOL) .

It should be noted that Milkomeda does not have any tokens. The Milkomeda team will not be in touch asking for funds or announcing token sales, because, again, there are no tokens.",1,0

2022-03-31 16:21:42,tt3gv8,Paying utility bills with crypto?,"""Not that I'm purchasing K4 Rally game tokens with ETH, but now I can pay utility bills with ETH,"" a buddy said to me a few days ago lol I thought he was joking, but it's true. Have you heard that the City of Chandler is now taking cryptocurrencies to pay utility bills?  


So, what's the deal? It’s one of the latest high-tech moves for one Valley community. Chandler is now allowing residents to pay their utility bills with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin.  


""By choosing PayPal, the crypto option will automatically display as a payment method in PayPal Checkout if there’s enough to cover the payment. The option started to be offered in March after the City worked with Invoice Cloud to make the payment option available. If they choose cryptocurrency, it will convert those into dollars based on the market value at that point. It’s a very small fee compared to the credit card fee, and the city has absorbed that through our utility services area"".  


Chandler may one of the first in the Valley to offer the option. Stewart said in a news release that the digital currency and blockchain are advancing quickly, and as the Community of Innovation, it is important to be at the forefront of this technology and offer it to their residents as a payment method for utility payments and other fees.  


Would you like to have this payment option in your city and what do you think about it?",1,0

2022-03-31 16:10:29,tt37wg,Buterin Claims Ethereum Simplicity is Still Possible,"Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, has stated that it is still possible to lower Ethereum's complexity while increasing its functionality. The announcement comes as several developers have lately expressed concerns about ETHs complexity.  


According to what I've read, he highlighted the Gasper PoS version, which ETH would eventually integrate into, claiming that it is a difficult but highly strong system. In comparison, there are far simpler and weaker implementations of PoS that may have been acceptable contenders, but they lack Gasper's benefits.  


""Buterin detailed that Ethereum has been struggling between two visions: one that values safety and simplicity (like Bitcoin), and another that intends to make Ethereum a highly performant and functional platform for building advanced applications.""  


It would be fantastic to reduce the difficulties that ETH brings us, especially when you consider the high gas prices and how busy the network is, which causes chaos. Most NFTs are minted on ETH, and you must use search engines like LUDO or something similar to find them because there are a bunch of them, therefore ETH is very important and we're using ETH on a daily basis for so many things.  


""My personal dream is to try to achieve both visions at the same time,"" he said, adding that it would take a long time and a great deal of effort to achieve this goal. However, he noted it is still possible to reduce complexity going forward.",2,0

2022-03-31 11:33:06,tsxq7u,VISA new NFT program to help small businesses into the digital economy.,"Credit card giant Visa has launched an NFT creator program in an effort to bring small businesses into the digital economy.

“We’ve seen rapid growth in the NFT ecosystem over the past year,” Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, told TechCrunch. “We think NFTs represent a new form of e-commerce.”

The idea of a small business is evolving from the traditional “brick-and-mortar mom-and-pop shops” to include other independent businesses with creators and entrepreneurs who want to build digital-focused companies and harness new tools like NFTs, Sheffield said.

The one-year immersion program, the Visa Creator Program, will bring together a global cohort of creators including artists, musicians, fashion designers and filmmakers the ability to build their businesses with NFTs.

There’s no “hard cap” on the number of creators for the first cohort and all members will have access to Visa clients and a broader network of mentors, Sheffield noted.

“Large merchants and brands are asking every day how they can get involved.” Sheffield said. “The thing that’s so exciting to us about NFTs is we think it lowers the barrier to entry for people to build a business and sell online.”

The traditional way of selling physical goods has a lot of logistics involved, which can be a huge challenge for small businesses and individuals to compete and scale. “NFTs allow someone who’s creative, who’s an artist, who’s talented, to produce a good entirely in a digital way,” Sheffield said.

Micah Johnson, a former Major League Baseball player and current artist behind Aku, was one of the first participants in the cohort. Visa previously announced the partnership in October 2021, but did not disclose that he was involved in the program at the time.",7,0

2022-03-31 03:32:11,tsqs2h,"Rollbit stole $43,421 worth of ETH from me"," 

On the 19th of November 9.5 ETH {$43,000) was stolen from me. It was done via what we now know to be a hijacking virus which was likely being used to watch what I was doing for the month prior.

I have evidence that shows it was installed by using a method of force downloading and installing a program, commonly referred to as ""drive-by hacking"" or a ""day zero hack"". It’s a form of targeted hack that requires no downloads from you, even cyber security experts I’ve hired are surprised by. The hackers laundered the money through Rollbit, a crypto gambling site on which I’d previously made YouTube videos and streamed on.

On the 25th of November, I contacted their support team. They offered me barely any information so I’m led to assume my money was gambled to a different account (owned by the hackers) via their roulette 1 on 1 gambling, and done with as they pleased.

This is Rollbit's responsibility as they have a policy on their site saying they require government ID for deposits of $2000+, which they did not have ([www.rollbit.com/aml](http://www.rollbit.com/aml)). They also must abide by report requirements, which they didn't but I’ll save that in case of a lawsuit. The AML policy stresses their safeguarding which is just a lie.

Despite efforts by law enforcement and I, Rollbit's support team is not offering me a refund for the deposits. They're trying every way to avoid paying me and it's actually disgusting. I make an effort in day-to-day life not to bring up my disability or complain about it because there's no real point and it makes it reasonable to expect less from myself, so I don't normally do it. But I'll make an exception; for a 20-year-old man in a wheelchair with a life-threatening disease, who can't walk, who is losing their speech, to in spite of all of that still have built up that amount, which is a lot of f\*\*\*ing money, is a big deal for me personally. For your support team to say that this is a ""disingenuous request to retrieve funds"" and mislead the police is absolutely sickening.

The fact is; your company allowed my money to be stolen, and you're not repaying me, take some responsibility.

The reason why I feel I deserve a refund is due to the fact Rollbit advertises their AML policy, which they for some reason didn't uphold which lead to my savings being stolen.

Update: it has been a month since I wrote the post above. After Rollbit support continuously told me that without law enforcement involvement they wouldn't help me. So I got the police involved back in January. Rollbit support since sent an email to Sussex Police saying this was a ""false claim"", so the police vouched and offered to show evidence.

That email was two months ago... Rollbit ghosted us and have been ignoring all further emails from both I and the police. So now I'm going to look for a lawyer to sue for it. Their actions have been disgusting and the lack of decency is inhumane.

If you are a lawyer and feel you would be able to represent me, please leave a comment.

I also want to say that Rollbit has broken the law, and did not ask for KYC, this is where the issue lies.

I’ll upload a youtube video on this ASAP, but I am disabled and my voice sounds like I'm high and drunk, thanks for reading.

The aim of this post is to spread awareness.",12,0

2022-03-30 18:17:32,tscr5e,"Now that ETH 2.0 is sustainable and eco-friendly, the environmental hard excuse is futile","Well, we all hated that ridiculous excuse that crypto, or Ethereum in this scenario, is anti-environemntal and hurts nature, and that mining is unsustainable and risky, well, now that proof-of-work and proof-of-stake is in, that is no longer a viable excuse. 

For the time that that excuse was corroborated, they were right. Yeah, mining was risky and harmful, unsustainable too, but as crypto moves into the ether, and now with the 2.0 version trying to make mining affordable and efficient, that is no longer the case. 

Not only that, but crypto is trying to solve existing issues that harm the environment as well. 

A lot of work is being put into creating the optimal word for humans as well, such as the work that the GoMining Token is putting in to make mining accessible to everyone, or the mining consensus of IOTA token, or how Plastik token is creating accountability for the use of single-use tokens, attaching each product to a token so that it could be traced and the polluting user could be traced down. 

I think the world of crypto understands that it isn’t only important to solve the issue within your sector, but that if crypto intends on being part of the common world is has to solve issues outside its sector as well.",0,0

2022-03-30 18:05:34,tschon,ETH closing high on the daily means there’s no stop to the rally,"Not only is Ethereum pumping hard, but despite the battle it’s seeing going up and down, but most importantly the 1d has closed on a major high, above a major resistance, and that’s very bullish news. 

The problem though, is that Ethereum is moving into a different phase, and most of its hodlers have understood this and have already changed their mentality about it. 

You see, now that Ethereum is more accessible for the largest whales, with a new proof-of-stake consensus, it makes it more of a store-of-value token, than a high utility token. I doubt that it will further be used for different purposes like NFTs or whatever, and will more likely be held by cold wallets as of now. 

Ethereum’s price has been propped up over the last week as anticipation builds for its massive software upgrade. Investors and developers are calling it “the merge,” and it’s expected to happen over the next few months. It will change how transactions on Ethereum are ordered, making it more efficient and sustainable for widespread use. But until that happens, experts are waiting to see how investors and companies building their tech on Ethereum’s platform respond to the changes. 


All this has made for a shaky start to the year for Ethereum, which in January dropped below $2,200 — the lowest Ethereum’s price had been since July 2021. Ethereum’s price has between $3,100 and $3,400 so far this week. Here’s how its current price compares to its daily high point over the last few months:

One week ago - 3013 usd         

One month ago - 2958 usd        

3 months ago - 3932 usd


It’s obvious that investors are holding the token more and more now. 

When major assets like BTC and ETH leave exchanges, it is generally a sign that investors are hoarding the assets because they expect a run upwards. The assets would be left on the exchanges for trading otherwise. As IntoTheBlock notes, when large amounts of ETH moved away from exchanges in Oct. 2021, it led to a 15% increase in price within ten days.

Ethereum outflows are at an all-time high, and now attention will be diverted elsewhere. It seems that now the world will be more occupied with the Metaverse and suku world and all that that makes part of the Meta, as it will be the major driver of the future. 

The future will be a lot different than today, and the projects of today are making that happen.",22,0

India’s tax authority has seized Rs. 95.86 crore (US$12.6 million) from 11 crypto exchanges on allegations of tax evasion.

The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), which oversees tax collection in India, had previously seized around Rs. 84 crore (about $11.0 million) in taxes and a further Rs. 1.1 crore ($145,000) in penalties, CoinDesk reported in January. India’s Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said the figure was closer to 95.86 crore ($12.6 million) in a statement Monday.

On Monday, both of the major cryptocurrencies got a boost, with Bitcoin up 6.2% and Ether up 6.8%, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin was trading at $47,630 and Ether was trading at $3,387 as of Monday morning.  


I must confess that I was concerned in recent months because all of this has been referred to as a crypto winter after Bitcoin fell to a low of around $33,184 and Ether plunged to a low of $2,455 in late January. However, this might be changing. Bitcoin was up roughly 43.5 percent and Ether was up 37.9 percent from their 90-day lows on Monday.  


I've heard as well that Ethereum’s blockchain is nearing a huge turning point that could push Ether’s market value ahead of Bitcoin’s. And what about this Etherlite blockchain, does it have anything to do with the Ethereum blockchain? I've noticed that many platforms started using it, nOFTEN is built on it as well.  


Now everyone is talking about how investors in Ether should be feeling bullish due to an upcoming update in the crypto’s underlying technology called the “merge” that could make it more environmentally friendly and introduce new revenue streams for the crypto-savvy. That update would also transform Ether from a “proof of work” blockchain, to “a proof of stake” blockchain.

So, what's the deal? Recently, there was a downside correction below $3,400. The price even fell below $3,350 but stayed over $3,320. It is also trading above the $3,300 mark and the 100-hour simple moving average. On the hourly chart of ETH/USD, a big bullish trend line is forming with support at $3,250.  


A low is formed near $3,335 and ether price is now rising. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,482 high to the $3,335 low.  


On the upside, the first resistance level is at $3,410. It is approaching the 50% Fib retracement level of the latest slide from the $3,482 high to the $3,335 low. The next significant resistance is located at $3,450. If there is a clear move above the $3,450 resistance, ether price might begin another ascent.  


If ETH does not begin a new upward trend over $3,450, it may begin another downward trend. On the downside, initial support is at $3,350. If the price falls below the $3,250 support zone, it may move towards the $3,100 level.  


The only thing that worries me now is the gas fee price. Do you have any opinions on how this will affect gas prices and so on? In any case, I'm staying with Metis.

Lowest gas price per transaction has been .00315 meaning, at current rates, I'm spending around $10 per transfer. Is there an alternative method that someone else might do as opposed to just eating the fees?

Is there a certain price point where you would rather cash out and transfer funds and rebuy as opposed to sending directly to a wallet? I've considered this but the tax implications are fairly substantial and also money would be tied up for around ~20 days from my experience. Take a few days to deposit into bank and then transfer USD to wallet or an exchange and then rebuy Ethereum on the new exchange.

Ownership renounced. LP locked. Let’s work together and see how much can be raised and donated!

The token is simple and needs little explanation. But in case you just woke up -

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This token is made to capitalize on the recent Oscar news/buzz where Will Smith got his ego hurt and assaulted Chris Rock over a joke. This was followed by Chris Rock taking the high road and not escalating the situation further. Will Smith was then treated as if he did nothing wrong in a room full of people. That’s not okay. Bully’s need to be told when they’re acting out and to stop. That’s why we want to raise more awareness and donate proceeds of this project to [www.bullyingcanada.com](https://www.bullyingcanada.com)

&#x200B;

i saw this show on netflix called breaking bad which sounded like a familiar name but i never watched it. i began watching it because the plot of a regular dude trying to sell meth for his family really intrigued me.

i ended up watching the whole thing eyes wide open jaw dropped the whole time. it was easily the best show i had ever seen and i currently can't imagine how any show can be better.

they made a spinoff series called better caul saul and i never watched it cuz i didn't think it would be better than breaking bad but word around the street is that people like it better than breaking bad.

2022-03-29 15:22:22,tr4h42,"Only a few years ago JP Morgan called cryptocurrency a FRAUD, now JP Morgan and other financial institutions are trying to flip each other in cryptocurrency investments!","It was only a few years ago that JP Morgan was calling cryptocurrency a fraud for years. 

[In 2017,](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-raises-flag-on-trading-revenue-sees-20-percent-fall-for-the-third-quarter.html) Dimon talked on every media outlet how cryptocurrency would be disastrous. 

[In 2019,](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/jp-morgan-is-rolling-out-the-first-us-bank-backed-cryptocurrency-to-transform-payments--.html) Dimon started to have a change of heart and declared a JPM coin would be created. The first bank backed cryptocurrency... he wasn't kidding, [JPM coin is real](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/news/digital-coin-payments). 

>JPM Coin is a permissioned, shared ledger system that serves as a payment rail and deposit account ledger, enabling participating J.P. Morgan clients to transfer US Dollars held on deposit with J.P. Morgan. JPM Coin facilitates real-time value movement, helping to solve common hurdles of traditional cross-border payments. 

I thought Dimon was so stupid to call cryptocurrency a scam and a fraud for YEARS! He got the media attention he wanted, but eventually realized he was EXTREMELY WRONG. He saw his competitors get on board with cryptocurrency with investing, research, and hands-on approach by hiring developers to create what the company needed. 

[In 2022,](https://decrypt.co/96284/caitlin-long-how-jp-morgan-flipped-goldman-sachs-in-crypto) news headlines are filled with institutional reach into cryptocurrency and how JP Morgan is trying to beat competitors in cryptocurrency investments and usage. How times have changed!

My point is, just like JP Morgan and Jamie Dimon was 100% against cryptocurrency and is now interested and taking part in the community is a game changer. For every cryptocurrency hater and shaker you know in the community, don't give up on them. It may take years like it did for Jamie Dimon, but eventually, they will come around and embrace cryptocurrency and digital currencies.

**TLDR:** Institutions went from calling cryptocurrency a fraud to being one of the biggest cryptocurrency investors. Cryptocurrency haters will eventually come around, even though it may take years for some! Don't give up brothers and sisters and cousins!

2022-03-29 14:43:36,tr1qyy,"When the PoR mechanism is combined with ETH's extensive acceptance and powerful features, it creates an extremely efficient combination","The ETH network, which has the largest ecosystem of decentralized apps and over four million unique users worldwide, remains the undoubted leader in the field of DeFi, which has grown so popular as a result of the ETH.  


I know I'm not the only one suffering from ETH issues, thus the flood of new users following the boom brought up concerns about scalability, network congestion, and pricing. These issues wreak on the ETH network and the decentralized apps that rely on it. As a result, users and developers have begun to search for potential solutions and found them in chains like Solana or Fantom.  


ETH records a low throughput of less than 15 tps and every time the traffic on the network increases, the fees for processing transactions become astronomical. On DEXs like Uniswap, the gas fees for a simple swap can sometimes go as high as $50 per trade.  


In this case, a proof-of-reputation consensus rather than a PoS consensus might be a valid option. The Kaiba Lightning Chain demonstrates the successful application of the PoR consensus. I noted that individuals are required to stake their identities rather than digital assets, which ensures that fraudulent players may be identified and removed from the network quickly. This protects the interests of the vast majority of fair-playing participants while allowing for scalability and cost.  


I would say that the whole PoR mechanism, when paired with ETH's extensive acceptance and powerful features, results in a very efficient synergy that addresses all of the difficulties raised above. What do you think?",10,0

For those that missed the Bored Ape Yacht Club boat, the APE token presents a unique opportunity, for investors to get in on the hype and sell the news, and they did. 

It quickly jumped up in prices and showed the world that hype machines are not over with, people still loving buying massive pumps. And for good reason, everyone loves making profit. 

Let’s not lie about it and admit that we all came here to win, and when we see an opportunity like that, we will just dump all into it and wait for a chance to sell at the peak, common human greed. 

Problem is, that despite being highly rewarding, it’s incredibly risky and unsustainable. 

Or did you think you’ll be able to flip monkey JPEGs forever? 

Honestly, I’m all for consistency. And I know that’s just old me who thinks that and that few share this opinion. That’s why when I’m staking my coins I find few who share this investment with me, and few know how rewarding it could be, and it could be very rewarding. I personally stake in defi for this sole reason, and my Werewolf stakes on the exchange have been fruitful. 

DeFi staking is not as it used to be. For the longest time staking was a bank’s game with low reward and would be stretched out on a timeline of years, but nowadays you can do it for as long as you want with high APYs too. 

Staking Ethereum before the 2.0 release is what most people are trying to do as of now, and people are rushing to do it. More eth is off exchanges and being staked than ever before, people know that consistency counts… 

I would never advise anyone to jump into the APE token, though if you choose to do that that’s on you and I won’t stop or judge you, we’re all here to win, and each in their own unique way.",2,0

But those who can see through the bullshit understand it has everything to do with REGULATION---namely the legal precedent that the ongoing Ripple SEC lawsuit will set for *Proof of Work* projects. That's why every time there's a new hearing, the Merge get's delayed until just after the next Ripple court date. If you look at the court dates for the Ripple lawsuit, then the changing dateline for the Merge, it's too accurate to be coincidence.

[https://twitter.com/HODLneverSODL/status/1467573571312570370?s=20&t=wpk3FbjLcCRG6nN3Ga01eA](https://twitter.com/HODLneverSODL/status/1467573571312570370?s=20&t=wpk3FbjLcCRG6nN3Ga01eA)

The last several weeks have been a disaster for the Ethereum Network's decentralization claims. From the Infura revelations to the Metamask transaction blocking. It's almost as embarrassing as its attention-loving founder showing up to a TIME interview to spout political beliefs, proffer medical advice, and more or less assert he's the central figure running Ethereum. He's still pumping out EIP's and posting them on Twitter in between his celebrity meetups.

Ethereum is an orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes, run by dapps that do nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going. Nothing in the network has established itself as money except stablecoins, which is why they make up 85% of its volume. This is a near-perfect example of *Gresham's Law* at work:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law)

Money by the way, is not TX cost, TPS, or throughput. Those are all features of a blockchain.

Ethereum can't scale (stated by Buterin himself recently) and relies on a cluster\*ck Layer-2 to help with this. If anyone wants to know what Ethereum Layer-2 is all about, they simply need to do this thought experiment:

>*Consider if bitcoin's Lightning Network required Zeus tokens to send, Achilles tokens to receive, and Hercules tokens to settle.*

It's a complete middleware mess of dapps, sidechains, bridges, and exploits. Even hard wallets get confused. The complexity and friction needed to choose the right option (of about 20) is about equal to the expense of just getting there and back. It's a joke. The claim is that shadring on L1 will magically scale the mess. It won't, not until ZK-rollups arrive at scale which creates an even bigger problem: full composability. Has anyone here even bothered asking what the hell happens when ZK's reach full composability? This is what happens: Dapps dump their L1 taxation into Boston Harbor. ETH the native utility/gas token becomes completely useless and only serves the purpose of driving up the costs of transactions, and making them slower. This won't be unique to just ETh, but will be the case for all altcoin L1's. And what do you think they'll put in their treasuries? Global stateless money. The same thing LUNA is busy buying with every dollar and token they can trade it for--BITCOIN. Their plan is $50B in BTC reserves over the next 12 months alone. Talk about eliminating any Triffin Dilemma.

[https://dailyhodl.com/2022/03/23/terra-luna-co-founder-reveals-purchase-for-3000000000-worth-of-bitcoin-btc-already-underway/](https://dailyhodl.com/2022/03/23/terra-luna-co-founder-reveals-purchase-for-3000000000-worth-of-bitcoin-btc-already-underway/)

And what of tokenized securities? What makes you think those won't replace all the vaporware and middleware contaminating Coinmarketcap currently? Coinmarketcap is already discussing this. These tokens will represent real bonds, real companies, real products, not your bullshit version of WEB3 that in reality requires both hardware and software to eliminate SAS, and create mesh networks that circumvent ISP's altogether. The type of sovereign computing bitcoin is currently busy putting in the meat space. Your version of WEB3 is tokenized orgies running on centralized server farms. About that:

The majority of ETH validators (Beacon Chain) are run by CEX's (who love Proof of Stake). The majority of all validators are hosted on Infura and AWS servers. This will get worse with the Merge. Where do the majority of dapps and wallets pull their API data from by the way? Anyone? Platforms that are 100% hosted on Infura servers, like Etherscan. Metamask won't even work without this API. So using the minimal brain cells you have in your head, why do you think Metamask caved to restricting transactions after Infura started blacking-out huge geographical regions related to the Russian sanctions starting three weeks back?

[https://decrypt.co/94315/ethereum-infura-cuts-off-users-separatist-areas-ukraine-accidentally-blocks-venezuela](https://decrypt.co/94315/ethereum-infura-cuts-off-users-separatist-areas-ukraine-accidentally-blocks-venezuela)

And those are just two of too many examples (of dapps and platforms) that make a mockery of decentralization.

[https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/metamask-blocks-ethereum-transactions-in-several-jurisdictions-citing-compliance-issues/](https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/metamask-blocks-ethereum-transactions-in-several-jurisdictions-citing-compliance-issues/)

Lastly, there's the biggest scam of all which is Proof of Stake, a consensus mechanism requiring zero continuous expense of resources, and zero work. No one-directional entropy. ""*Fuck physics, let me validate your transactions, bro.""* If you want to know what Proof of Stake is all about, try this thought experiment:

>*Imagine a Senator is appointed to a lifetime term, is required to do no work, and with his colleagues can set his own salary.*

These are really only the opening problems that arise from PoS which creates an even worse system than we have now, cantillionaires galore.

I'd also be remiss to not mention EIP's like 1559 which was designed to manipulate a token supply, and passes itself off as the driver of *ultrasound money*. 🤦‍♀️ Nobody can take such a system seriously.

What the financial system needs is an immaculate base layer that everything can build around. Something like fire, the wheel, electricity, or the internet. Something that can't be re-invented of which there is only one way to build right--immaculate layers, like atoms have, the human body has, planets have, or even pizza has. For some time, this immaculate base layer was gold, but it was easily seized, easy to mess with physically, constrained by borders, rules could't be enforced, and was an analog payment network. Now we have fiat and Central Banks as the base layer. It doesn't work. The next base layer for the next 100+ years won't be a cluttered shitcoin dystopia hellbent on centralizing itself that can't even build a simple second layer right. No. Simplicity is a fundamental security practice. The s-curve adoption shakeout coming for the crypto space will be like watching Maurizio Pollini play a 9-foot concert grand. Satisfying AF.

I saw that a second transaction, to an address I don't recognize, was made, and without my approval. What's seems weird to me is that in ""activity"" on metamask I only have 1 transaction, ""in""(from the binance transaction) but in etherscan I have 2, the ""in"" one (from 18 days ago) and the last thats says ""out""(from 2 days ago) I have not went into any sketchy sites and have my passwords and recovery phrase written in paper.

Some of the most recent information I came across are:   
\- Ethereum exceeds several biggest financial institutions in market capitalization.   
\- Its market cap recorded a 10.47% increase in just a week, sitting at around $366.13 billion at the time.   
\- Ethereum is trading at $3,111.7 at the present time.   
 

This all appears to be great, but the only thing that has been bothering me about ETH is the gas fees and slow transactions that we've been dealing with for a long time. Even though it's been cheaper recently, I feel more relieved using L2 solutions, whether that's Metis or Loopring, or anything else.   
 

When it comes to this latest news, I believe that JPMorgan Chase is the only financial institution that is likely to be above Ethereum at the time of issuance, which is correct - with a market valuation of $419.06 billion.   
 

""The current market value of ETH has risen up to $816.74, showing a stable increase. By that, Ethereum has been recorded as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, next to Bitcoin."" which was stated in an article I've read.

The Ethereum Merge is coming: what, why and when?

Ethereum Energy Consumption

Since its inception in 2015, Ethereum has been pushing through the new frontiers of cryptocurrencies, adding a block of transactions every 12 or 13 seconds on average through its Proof-of-Work consensus. Today, Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work security model is estimated to consume roughly 100 TWh per year according to Digiconomist, the equivalent of a country like the Netherland — or 3% of the US energy consumption. (The Ethereum Foundation shows a similar trend.)

&#x200B;

[To date, I've earned 3.4 ETH just from staking. Stack, stake and HODL ETH to richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/otvt2kj6f6q81.jpg?width=1134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1768afe71b85c9d09853e39263fb678d8112dfc3)

What is Proof-of-Stake?

While this is only half of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, the trend has been worrying the Ethereum community for a while. In response, a new consensus algorithm has been under development for the past few years: Proof-of-Stake. The Proof-of-Stake algorithm does not rely on solving difficult math problems as Proof-of-Work does, and so it can work with very limited computing power, and hence be much more energy-efficient.

Proof-of-State consensus replaces the “miners” of Proof-of-Work by “validators”: to participate in the consensus, validators must lock some capital (in the form of ETH) into a smart contract — that’s the staking. Validators are then chosen randomly to propose the next block or to validate someone else’s block. In return, they get a reward proportional to their stake.

&#x200B;

[My All-ETH portfolio is surging to a 1-month high!!! Up well over USD$150K in just a few weeks since the low on March the 7th. Stack, stake and HODL ETH \(5 years minimum time horizon\) to richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/2d5dosv7f6q81.jpg?width=1134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1b92218fa334a2d348e321e115d7a2a736bcb2c)

If a validator behaves fraudulently, its stake will be “slashed”: it will be taken away. This ensures that validators stay honest and keep doing their work correctly.

Proof-of-Stake replaces the heavy machinery necessary for Proof-of-Work with lightweight computing. There is no need to buy expensive equipment or spending huge amounts of electricity to participate in securing the network.

The move to Proof-of-Stake is estimated to reduce the energy consumption of the Ethereum network by 99.95%. In other words, to divide it by a factor 2,000. That would put Ethereum’s consumption in line with a country like Tonga, a Polynesian archipelago with a population of 100,000.

The Beacon Chain is already running

Even though Ethereum has not switched to Proof-of-Stake completely yet, staking had already been taking place since December 2020 on what’s called the Beacon Chain.

The Beacon chain is a chain that runs in parallel to Ethereum’s main chain and uses the Proof-of-Stake consensus. Right now, the Beacon chain does not validate any Ethereum transaction or smart contract execution, it only validates its own blocks.

While a minimum stake of 32 ETH is required to become a validator, users with less cash can gather their funds into staking pools, such as RocketPool or Staked — similarly to Proof-of-Work’s mining pool,. This allows anyone to join the staking process and participate in the Beacon chain’s security: the more Eth is staked, the more secure the network.

Of important note, ETH staked cannot currently be “unstaked” or withdrawn. This will only be implemented when Ethereum has fully completed the move to Proof-of-Stake.

Despite this restriction, 10 million ETH is currently locked into the staking contract, or about $28 Billion! That amounts to more than 8% of the circulating supply.

The Merge

Right now, Ethereum is like a spaceship running with an old engine — Proof-of-Work. It’s polluting, it’s costly, but it’s also complicated to replace.

The Beacon chain is like a newer engine, clean and energy efficient, that runs in parallel to the spaceship. It runs on Proof-of-Stake.

The final step is going to disconnect Ethereum’s old engine and swap it with the new one. This step is called the Merge, and it’s approaching very quickly. It could happen as early as this summer, according to several speakers at Eth Denver 2022.

So what will happen after the Merge?

Right now, nodes running Ethereum software (Eth1 clients) take care of both execution (transactions and smart contracts) and consensus (Proof-of-Work).

Nodes of the Beacon chain run their own software, called Eth2 clients. Eth1 and Eth2 clients barely talk to each other.

After the Merge, nodes will run these two pieces of software in parallel: the Eth1 client for execution (with Proof-of-Work disabled), and the Eth2 client for consensus. The newer piece will coordinate blocks and talk to the execution piece who will take care of contracts and transactions.

By taking this modular approach, the Merge is not reinventing the wheel. It takes what already works, turns off what is not used anymore, and only adds a newer, cleaner, engine.

What are the pros of Proof-of-Stake for Ethereum?

On top of the tremendous reduction in energy consumption, Proof-of-Stake will bring a few additional features to Ethereum.

One of the them is constant block time. In Proof-of-Work, blocks are added when they are “found”, at an average of 13 seconds between blocks, but blocks are frequently found under 3 seconds or above 30 seconds.

Since Proof-of-Stake’s random selection does not depend on solving math puzzles, the block time can be fixed. It will be exactly 12 seconds after the Merge. Predictable block times are useful for time critical applications.

Another advantage is that Proof-of-Stake gives actual finality, meaning that if a block has been approved by the validators, it won’t ever be reversed, whereas in Proof-of-Work there’s always a possibility, however small, that someone is secretly mining a longer chain and will trigger a malicious reorganisation.

Proof-of-Stake is still vulnerable to 51% attacks — like Proof-of-Work, but the risk of such attacks is mitigated as it’s even costlier to implement in Proof-of-Stake, and the financial risk is enormous for the attacker.

What Proof-of-Stake doesn’t do

The Merge is not a solution to scalability: switching to Proof-of-Stake is not going to increase Ethereum’s capacity magically. However, it’s an important step as it opens the door to sharding, the technique that allows validators to specialize in smaller parts of the transactions and smart contracts, in effect introducing parallel computing to blockchains. (The scalability roadmap for Ethereum is sharding + rollups — see below.)

The financial side

Many expect the price of Ethereum to drop significantly after the Merge. The rationale is that, after withdrawing — or unstaking — is implemented, stakers will run to cash in their potential gains.

While this may happen, in practice it will be greatly mitigated by limits imposed in the system: only about 900 validators will be allowed to exit every day, from a current total of 220,000. If validators do choose to exit, it will be a slow bleed, not a bank run!

Another important financial aspect is that, since Proof-of-Stake uses very little energy, it is not necessary anymore to issue a lot of new coins to pay the miners’ costs, which means that, with the help of EIP 1559 burning ether every day (see below), Eth could even become a deflationary asset.

Conclusion

The Merge is probably the most momentous event in the history of Ethereum. The move to Proof-of-Stake has been in the works for at least 5 years and it’s very exciting to be on the doorstep of such an event.

With billions being transacted everyday on the Ethereum network, the stakes (no pun intended) are extremely high. But, if successful, the Merge could even trigger other blockchains to switch to Proof-of-Stake. Let’s see what happens this summer.",0,0

2022-03-28 19:18:47,tqgzx7,Anticipation for ETH merge is giving us a price rally we have not seen in a while,"
The next merge of Ethereum onto the 2.0 net, especially after the test net went live and was successful, has caused a lot of hype around Ethereum and is pushing up prices like we haven’t seen in a long time. Finally, a new eth update, the world has been waiting of this for a while. 

It’s been a while since Ethereum has been afk, and now they’re back with a massive move. The recent news has brought up some serious stir in the media and is bring back old users and new users alike into Eth again, as all are excited for the new move up. 

I really think prices will reach an all-time high, as it is projected that in the new update it will not only include venerated and veteran crypto users singularly, but mass corporations as well. This is next piece into the mass adoption the world has been waiting for. 

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that since the successful launch on Kiln, the price of Ether has climbed 25% from $2,500 to a daily high at $3,193 on March 25 as traders look to lock in their positions ahead of the merge.

This too could have serious implications on the web 3.0 and defi move, as new currencies in the market like Avax and Chainlink and Aloha Defi come to take the place of Ethereum as a fluid, liquid currency in the market as eth becomes a currency for different utilities and users. 

The merge that is projected will have positive implications all around and now it as good as a time as ever to be invested in Ethereum.",95,0

“Bitcoin’s price shot up above $47,000 this morning – a price that we hadn’t seen since January 2nd. The volatility also took its toll on the market, leaving over $410 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours.”

I don’t know, but for some reasons I love seeing people who bet against BTC get liquidated on their shorts. These are the same people who are ‘bullsih’ on fiat money and tactics that have rendered the world helpless and created mass poverty all around the globe.

You can’t bet against ideas of the future, and recent events have highlighted this. Just goes to show that thee world wants to move forward ahead, despite of resistance being seen from different parties, the world just wants to develop, and people just want to move forward. 

This is further highlighted by the emergence of web 3.0 and defi, with tokens like Helium, Flux, or Aloha Defi taking up the scene. This move represents the future, and it can’t be halted. There’s no room for resistance in a world that wants to keep marching forward. 

The stage is set and all eyes are set on reaching new pinnacles before the summer, eth 2.0 is locked in, btc is rallying up, nfts are back in the game, and crypto is more desired than ever before.

It’s full charge into the future now with little left to stop us.",13,0

Why am I not surprised? 

They just wanted to act like environmentalists for a while and boost attention for themselves, lapping up all that attention from the world as they stand against crypto. It’s inevitable that crypto will be a part of our lives whether we chose to opt for it or not, and the less we fight it the sooner we get there. 

There’s no denying that their resistance is understandable I mean this is not your friend buying some bitcoins and hoping for the best, this is world politics we are talking about it. And they had to check whether or not crypto could be legitimate entity of the world, or at least their world.

They couldn’t find a way around crypto, so they had to go for it and legislate it, finally they have begun to understand. 

As the world goes into this next chapter of finance and economics those who resist will be left behind, and those who adapt will be the pioneers of the next chapter. The DeFi move up is pushing this move even stronger with web 3 tokens taking the platform such as Theta or Aloha defi and the DAO movement is making corporations fairer than ever. 

The world seems to have its sight set on accepting crypto at last, and it’s due time we stopped ignoring this move and starting accepting it as it is.",102,0

When the Merge happens, the returns on Ethereum are going to be between 10% to 15% per year,"" said Ran Neuner, Crypto Trader. GLTA!!!","By Kitco News, Monday March 28, 2022

The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, otherwise known as ""The Merge,""is expected to launch by the end of June and is ""the biggest news in crypto today,""said Ran Neuner, founder and host of The Crypto Banter, co-founder of Crypto Trader, and CEO of OnChain Capital.

[From $0.00 to almost half a million U.S. dollars worth of Ethereum!!! Stack, stake and HODL ETH through thick and thin to richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/97nps335o5q81.jpg?width=1140&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2238cfeae8993261039228c192ac3a793872704e)

Developers have successfully tested the merge of Ethereum's proof-of-work and proof-of-stake chains, which will allow ether staking to generate yields of up to 10% to 15%, according to experts.

Importantly, The Merge will reduce Ethereum's carbon footprint significantly, Neuner told Michelle Makori, editor-in-chief of Kitco News.

""Proof of work is a very high electricity consumption, very high equipment consumption way of mining cryptocurrencies or proving transactions. And it is one of the big criticisms that Bitcoin faced,""he said.

Bitcoin, which runs on the proof-of-work network, has been the subject of criticism for its environmental footprint.

Neuner noted that when Tesla CEO Elon Musk made the announcement that Tesla is accepting payment in Bitcoin, he received pushback from his Board of Directors about using a non-ESG (environmental social governance) friendly asset when the company is trying to preserve an image of being one of the greenest companies in the world.

Recently, the European Union contemplated banning Bitcoin due to its lack of ESG qualities, although members of the European Parliament voted not to ban it.

""So, what they're doing is they're moving Ethereum from proof-of-work to a much more energy efficient proof-of-stake. It's much more energy efficient and it's much faster. The only issue is that somehow you have to combine the chains: the old proof-of-work chain and the new proof-of-stake chain,""he said.

There's also the issue of scaling that proof-of-stake aims to fix.

""Proof of work is also not very scalable, and one of the big criticisms that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have been facing, and specifically Ethereum…which uses proof-of-work mining, cannot keep up with the transactions that are required,""Neuner said, noting that Ethereum is needed for not just investments but is being adopted by a wide range of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

Ethereum will also see its supply shrink over time, Neuner said.

""The second thing that happens, which is very, very interesting right now, Ethereum has an uncapped supply. Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million but Ethereum has an uncapped supply, which means that theoretically, you could keep printing ETH forever and Ethereum is not scarce. But Ethereum also has another mechanism which is called a burning mechanism. When every transaction is completed we burn a certain number of Ethereum. When we destroy the net burn, they're gone forever,"" he said. ""And so the Ethereum emissions, the amount of Ethereum that are being created every day, are going to be reduced by 90%.""

Last, The Merge will reward Ethereum holders with a higher yield when the token is staked.

""The returns today on staking Ethereum are 3.9%,""he said. ""When the merge happens, the returns on Ethereum are going to be between 10% to 15% per year.""

In theory, if the burn rate exceeds the rate at which new ETHs are being created, the supply of Ethereum would shrink indefinitely until it approaches zero, although Neuner noted that could take ""thousands of years.""

""Ethereum becomes deflationary, so now, you've got an energy efficient, deflationary asset. Get into the mind of a fund manager. You can invest in Bitcoin, which is moderately inflationary, and heats up the atmosphere and is non-ESG friendly and deflationary,""he said. ""It's actually becoming more and more scare. Where in the world do you have the opportunity to invest in a scare asset, and by the way earn 10% to 15% return? I've never heard of it.""

Neuner himself is more heavily invested in Ethereum as compared to Bitcoin, as he sees more growth in the former.

However, the ""Ethereum Flippening,""the theory that Ethereum's market cap will overtake Bitcoin's, is still not happening anytime soon.

""I think maybe in a couple of years, that is a discussion for it to be happening, but let's look at what's happening right now,""he said. ""For a long time, ETH was devaluing against Bitcoin until about January 2020, and since January 2020, actually that trend has been completely reversed and we're seeing ETH strengthen towards Bitcoin. Flippening…that's a little bit ambitious. For now, if you ask me, if you've got a gun to your head and can only invest in one, Bitcoin or ETH? My money's on ETH.""",0,0
