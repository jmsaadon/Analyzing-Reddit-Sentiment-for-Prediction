2022-04-09 19:58:13,u00ywy,Some people consider DeFi staking high risk and I don’t really know why,"DeFi staking allows you to gain free crypto, making it an easy way to earn a passive income. However, as with any other investment, there are risks involved. Why is DeFi staking considered high risk?

DeFi staking is high risk due to the holding period and volatility. Even if you earn a decent amount of interest on your stakings, the price could plummet at any moment, causing you to lose money. It can also take a few days to unstake your crypto and rewards, meaning you can’t sell right away. 


In most cases, you'll have to lock up your crypto for up to a month when you first begin staking. If you plan on holding your crypto for a long time, this won't be a problem for you. But if you plan on selling when prices start plummeting, this may be an issue.

Fees. Staking has fees. Try to find the one with the lowest costs.

You could lose all your rewards. You might make a decent amount of passive crypto from staking. However, prices could drop overnight, and all your rewards may be gone. You could even lose money if this happens. Always keep this in mindbefore deciding to stake your crypto.

Unstaking. You may want to sell your crypto as quickly as possible if the price is high and you fear it'll begin to plummet. In many cases, you have to wait a few days before you can withdraw your crypto from the stake pool, so this could cause you to lose potential earnings.

Useless stake pool. You may have chosen a bad or small stake pool and realize you're not making any extra crypto. It takes time and effort to stake your crypto in the first place, so unstaking it and staking it again in a different stake pool is even. 

Despite all of these there are still many projects on the market that change the tone of this argument. Projects like Lycan right now has incorporated DeFi staking well despite being relatively new, and so has even brands like Binance and many others, trying their best to solve these problems aforementioned. 

There are also many advantages to DeFi staking. 

Earn rewards. The main reason people choose to stake their crypto is to earn more crypto. It's an incentive for people to actively participate in the blockchain and a great way to get involved.

It's generally straightforward. The easiest way to stake your crypto is by using a stake pool, which an operator runs. This way, you don't have to worry about becoming a node or doing anything complicated. All you need to do is choose a stake pool, add your crypto, and you're done.

Eco-friendly. In general, staking is more eco-friendly than the proof of work mechanism, which Bitcoin and Ethereum currently use. However, Ethereum is currently switching from a proof of work to a proof of stake mechanism, so you can",40,0

I’ll admit I have not looked too deeply into the official announcement about the “cancellation” of ETH 2.0 in favor of the Beacon upgrade, but what does that mean if we’ve staked ETH with platforms like Coinbase or Kraken?

On Coinbase, they convert your ETH to ETH2. And both these platforms payout in ETH2. Is that all just gone/worthless now? Or is this mostly semantics, and the name is what’s cancelled?

Platforms (at least the ones I’m using) have not addressed this announcement yet in any official capacity, so I thought I’d ask those with potentially more knowledge than I have.",2,0

2022-04-08 15:54:56,tz6nn5,"P2P OTC trading platform, Dexpools, to launch on Ethereum on April 12th","So why exactly is P2P trading exciting? Like anything that can be swapped–used cars, houses, drugs–it's generally cheaper to go straight to the source. I can get that 2002 Pontiac Sunfire a lot cheaper on Craigslist than I can from [Big Bill's Used Cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1dUk8x2XkA), and I should be able to swap my ETH for USDC with someone else if someone is also looking to trade it. Cryptocurrency doesn't currently have a place to **securely** trade peer-to-peer for the masses, and I have come across a project that is finally developing this utility:

#Dexpools

https://dexpools.com/

Dexpools is developing its platform to provide traders, gamers, and NFT collectors the ability to securely trade publicly or privately on any EVM-compatible chain. Beginning April 12th, users will be able to set up secure swaps with their contacts, list their offer on the open market, or search trades on the open market to fulfill on Ethereum (or Metis). If the market radically shifts after you have listed an offer, you are able to cancel even if another user has begun the process of completing the transaction because it requires mutual approval in the end... or if you really want to get rid of something (and aren't worried about the market), you can provide approval ahead of time. Rather than face high slippage fees, the users would just be required to pay a low transaction fee to the platform.

The Dexpools platform addresses several markets:

- Enabling every-day traders to find and securely trade any token, off-market
- Letting NFT collectors and gamers find and swap their digital assets for other digital assets including any combination of NFTs and ERC20 tokens
- Helping founding teams and major treasuries take profits while preventing negative market impact on its holders

Currently, there is more than $100 million swapped in OTC trades each day. All of these trades are done to avoid slippage, front-running, and other issues found with AMM liquidity pools. Dexpools is providing the platform to search out these trades with other users, and that number could grow immensely with its adoption– especially with plans to include Polygon, Avalanche, Moonbeam, Moonriver, BSC, and Fantom.

Lastly, they are offering a utility token–DXP–that will allow stakers to obtain platform rewards such as airdrops and claims gathered from a percentage of all fees generated across swaps. Stakers would also obtain upcoming access to premium features including cross-chain swaps, limit orders, automation and more. They launched their token yesterday, and it's available on Uniswap. Obviously do your own research before delving into this project (or wait to use the trading platform on Tuesday).

I thought I would share something that I believe will benefit the users, truly encompasses the decentralization aspect of cryptocurrency.",2,0

Extensive research about a blockchain project takes time and is very frustrating, leading people to take impulsive decisions based on emotions. As we are all living in the era of Tiktok and other instant content, taking the time and having the effort to research becomes a rarity among investors. 

What pros & cons do you find for these market intelligence platforms?

2022-04-08 04:07:55,tyv07a,NFT games that you think are worthwhile?," Since P2E games began to appear, I've been eager to see and play rally games, which I've always enjoyed ever since I was a child. I’m new to NFTs and I really want to play rally games since that’s what I love playing. But the thing is, I don’t think there are a lot of NFT rally games or I’m just not looking hard enough? Lol. At the moment, I’m looking into these two:  
[Revv Racing](https://www.revvracing.com/): first blockchain-based racing game. I’m actually still thinking about this since I think I’m already too late to get a pretty good car at a decent price? Anyways, I have watched other people’s gameplay on YT and it’s good enough for me even though it’s not a rally game. They have a weekly racing challenge/event which is cool. I also love their car designs.   
[K4 Rally:](https://k4rally.io/) first blockchain-based rally game. Compared to Revv, I’m much early on this. They still haven’t launched the game yet and haven’t dropped their NFTs yet. They will also have a beta test this April and I hope I can be one of the testers so that I can know whether I will push through with this. I like their idea of NFT rentals for an additional profit for the owner. Also, real rally champions are part of their team to make better gameplay for the users.  Looks like they want to unite the motorsport and the blockchain community. What do you guys think about that??   
There’s also this game called [sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) that’s not a rally/racing game but I’m kinda interested in it since they said will be kinda similar to Minecraft which I enjoy playing too! I heard it from a friend and I haven’t really done a lot of research yet lol.   
Lastly, What do you guys think about [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)? I want to try it but their website keeps crashing or just keeps loading when I’m still customizing my character. Maybe it’s better if it’s like sims where you need to download it and not just play it on a browser? It looks pretty fun though since you can do a lot of things on the game.  
I don't think I have a lot of options, so I'm open to playing different kinds of games, not just rally games, so if you could recommend me more P2E games, I'd be grateful.",115,0

But i also know that i invested in sol when it was $78 being very confident that it would go back to over $100 short term. I ended up being correct but i only put like 7% of my portfolio into sol because i figured i’d limit my risk. This is all good because it can just as easily go down as it can up. But it’s hard seeing your small investment double when your portfolio as a whole doesn’t change too much. Why not just buy the alt coins if you’re confident and get much greater returns? this is a struggle for me",0,0

2022-04-07 15:33:55,tyfnw4,Did you know that the average 7-day fees paid to the Ethereum protocol are about 40 times higher than those paid to Bitcoin?,"Today I read the news about how the average 7-day fees paid to Ethereum protocol are almost 40x higher than Bitcoin’s.  


""As a matter of fact, Ethereum’s seven-day average fees on April 5 amounted to $24,487,397, which is 39.29 times or 190.1% more than $623,285 – the seven-day fee average of Bitcoin."" This really did not surprise me since all of us are using so many gas fee solutions, such as Metis or any other L2 solution, we're lucky that now we have so much choice cause there are a lot of them.  


Ethereum’s transaction fees are at their lowest levels for more than eight months, currently sitting at $5.81. In contrast, the average gas fee on November 8, 2021, stood at $62.85.  


Do you recall how analysts linked an increase in Ethereum gas fees in 2021 to an increase in NFT sales on the Ethereum network? This is not surprising given that we have new marketplaces every month, whether it's SK8coin or some NFT-powered game like K4 Rally, or popular ones like Axie Infinity, or any other cause this might truly have an influence on high gas fees.  


Even the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin himself has admitted this. Indeed, the network’s high fees have long presented a major challenge to its usability and a threat to the vision of creating a decentralized economy.",13,0

There’s also the fact that Ethereum’s scalability issues didn’t show its true magnitude up until the beginning of 2020 around the time where L2s started gaining popularity.

Don’t expect “ETH2.0” to be completed right away. Things like this take time. Even Vitalik described it as a process and that up until then, Ethereum will focus mostly on ZK rollups and sharding.

This is why I’m guess Vitalik has been a fan of Polygon for the longest. They’re technically the best out there when it comes to ZK tech with $1 billion allocated just for ZK development purposes. They currently have the largest number of ZK solutions from SNARKs and STARKs.

So don’t get too impatient. ETH2.0 is more of journey that has a patches, fixes and improvements all along the way. So relax and enjoy these improvements one by one.",16,0

2022-04-07 06:13:07,ty6kpa,keys by which Ethereum surpasses Binance Chain and other networks,"Ethereum was launched in 2015 as a general purpose network specializing in smart contracts. Since then, it has stood out as the undisputed leader of decentralized applications (dApps), but it is not alone in the race. Since 2020, numerous developments have been birthed with the aim of dethroning her reign. 

Binance Smart Chain —now called BNB Chain— was the one who first stepped in strongly with the development of new decentralized applications to try to bring Ethereum users to its environment. The congestion that existed in the network co-created by Vitalik Buterin, at the height of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, made the user experience less pleasant and commissions rose to unprecedented prices. 

Since then, several other networks have been launched or promoted aggressively to attract attention and money from investors. Among these « *Ethereum killers* » (killers of Ethereum, in English), Polygon (previously called Matic), Solana, Fantom, Avalanche and Terra can be mentioned. 

Although it has increasing competition, Ethereum is still king. Data from the statistics page defillama.com shows that, of the networks specialized in smart contracts (this is, basically, the possibility of programming transactions), [Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) maintains its dominance with 55% of the value deposited, at the time of publication of this Article. 

With faster and more scalable networks, which provide a much better user experience, why don't users fully migrate to them? There are three reasons why Ethereum's dominance remains and possibly will continue to do so at least in the short to medium term. Next, each of them is analyzed. 

## 1. Ethereum is years ahead of the race 

Before reading on, take a few seconds to imagine a Cola drink. Do not go to the next sentence without having done that exercise. 

Ready? Possibly, you have thought of Coca-Cola. Maybe in Pepsi-Cola… but it is unlikely that you have thought of a Manaus Cola (or the alternative brand that exists in your country). 

Some boxers say that whoever hits first, hits twice. What happens with colas and boxers, also happens in the vast market of distributed networks. 

Why is Bitcoin the leading cryptocurrency in the market since its launch? Among many other reasons, for having been the first. And the same applies to Ethereum, in the field of networks specialized in smart contracts (it is worth clarifying that Bitcoin also allows them, but the[ development of Ethereum ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development)makes it much easier, although it sacrifices decentralization in part to achieve it). 

In these years, with successes and failures, the Ethereum development team has achieved a product that is the emblem when it comes to platforms for the development of decentralized applications. 

In the words of the investment firm Grayscale, recently reviewed by CriptoNoticias, those who use Ethereum can rest assured that it will continue to be ""the center of gravity"" for application innovation and liquidity.

Also, the years of advantage that Ethereum has in the race for smart contract networks, allowed it to build a huge community of users, as will be detailed in the following intertitle. 

## 2. Ethereum's network effect outperforms its competitors 

Finance consultant Lyn Alden defines the network effect as ""the attribute of a company or other system that the more people use the network, the more valuable it becomes to each user."" She maintains this businesswoman that this effect ""is one of the strongest economic points that a system can have against its competitors."" 

For the case analyzed here, Ethereum's consolidated user base (including individual developers, companies, product consumers, etc.) can be considered one of its strengths . 

Let's see it with some companies, for example, Apple. If more people buy iPhones, then more companies will develop applications for these devices. In turn, many people will want to purchase these phones to use the applications created. An upward spiral is formed that favors the company. 

In the case of Ethereum, the development of new decentralized applications attracts new users. The programmers, seeing that their potential market is expanding, have a stimulus for the development of new applications. As in the Apple example, in Ethereum, the upward spiral favors the network.

There is also a network effect between developers. The greater the development of applications, the more experience, design tools, etc. This, in turn, makes it easier to create new applications. 

This latest network effect is what will see Ethereum continue to maintain its dominance for years to come, according to Andrei Hagiu and Julian Wright , investors and professors at the universities of London and Singapore, respectively.

*here are more developers working on Ethereum projects than any other blockchain. As long as there are more new Ethereum projects than there are new projects on any other blockchain, its advantage will continue to grow in this regard.* 

*Andrei Hagiu and Julian Wright, investors and university professors.* 

These authors consider that the congestion that can be caused by the network effect in Ethereum could be remedied by the use of second layer solutions. Although they mistakenly name Polygon (which is not a second layer but a side chain with its own accounting), it could well be exemplified with rollups, which decongest the main network, without leaving the Ethereum ecosystem. 

However, they see a danger for Ethereum in the long term, that developers are becoming more versatile and can adapt to the code of different decentralized networks . “New layer 1 blockchains like Solana are based on more popular programming languages, which could partially negate the network effect advantage that [Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) enjoys because of its developers,” they explain. 

## 3. Ethereum, more decentralized and secure than the competition 

The Cryptonews Glossary defines a node as “a computer or server connected to the network, which is capable of transmitting information to others”. It is specified there that “a decentralized blockchain is made up of multiple nodes”.

In the case of cryptocurrency networks, the nodes store a copy – which can be partial or complete – of the blockchain. The greater the number of nodes, the greater the decentralization of the network, which in turn makes it more secure. The latter is so because it makes it difficult to massively corrupt those who run them so that they commit actions that threaten the network. 

At the time of publication of this article, Ethereum has 5,599 nodes , according to information published on the ethernodes.org website . Unlike other networks of this type, anyone who wants to can run a node

* Binance's network, BNB Chain, has only 21 active validator nodes . 
* Terra has 130 validator nodes . 
* Avalanche has 1,354 validator nodes . 
* Polygon has 100 validator nodes . 
* Solana has 1,654 validator nodes . 
* Fantom has 66 active validator nodes . 

Buterin argues that it is impossible for a cryptocurrency network to meet the ""trilemma"" of scalability, security, and decentralization. Ethereum, on its mainnet, focuses on the last two aspects. Instead, the networks mentioned here favor scalability. In this way they manage to offer a better user experience to attract money to their ecosystems, although at the expense of security and decentralization. 

In April 2021, CriptoNoticias reviewed an investigation specifically dealing with the BNB Chain case . Despite almost a year having passed since its publication, the text remains fully valid. 

At the time, Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at the Messari company, said:

*The reason Binance Smart Chain is faster and more scalable is not due to magical technological innovation, but rather due to the magic of centralization. (…) It is nothing more than a fork of Ethereum with a set of centralized validators. (…) \[Binance exchange\] has terrible reach and influence and has used it to funnel a lot of new users into DeFi* 

*Watkins, Messari Research Analyst* 

This is why Watkins states that on the Binance blockchain, while “fees and speed are undoubtedly preferable, strong censorship resistance and fault tolerance are not part of the package.” 

These characteristics put Ethereum in a position of superiority over its main competing networks and make it especially interesting for large investors. The wealthiest wallet users (including institutional investors) will prefer a secure network, rather than a faster one, but with higher points of failure .  

Ethereum 's high commissions , which are a huge problem for those who operate with small amounts, can be considered insignificant in the case of millionaire investments.  

## Ethereum, a network with advantages and challenges 

From all that has been said, it is clear that dethroning Ethereum as the main network for the development of decentralized applications and the execution of smart contracts will not be an easy task. 

However, the team of developers and Vitalik Buterin, as the most influential person in the etherean field, must not be neglected if they want to maintain the leadership.

he competition is on the prowl to take advantage. And, as if that were not enough, new developments in Bitcoin are gradually making its programmability easier . If it follows this course, the network created by Satoshi Nakamoto could also become a strong competitor for Ethereum in the market for decentralized applications.",0,0

2022-04-06 23:12:47,txyz6g,Uniswap V3 Liquidity Mining: Exploring the Options,"&#x200B;

Since at least 2019, Web3 projects have been incentivizing their communities to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any protocol and facilitating that liquidity in one way or another is a basic prerequisite for a successful project.

When Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap were the dominant DEXes, liquidity mining was relatively straightforward. All liquidity deposits on those exchanges are natively fungible, meaning that any deposit is directly comparable to any other one. Additionally, all liquidity deposits on those exchanges “cover” the full price range of the two assets in the pool, meaning that the AMM formula would serve up a price if token0 approached  an infinite value relative to token1 and, similarly, if token1  approached an infinite value relative to token0.

Uniswap V3 is now the dominant DEX, owing largely to its more expressive functionality. But with a richer feature-set comes greater complexity. One major casualty of Uniswap V3 is that liquidity mining now requires a profound technical expertise. Even launching an incentive on the full  price range — the most common approach to Uni V3 LM to date — still necessitates a degree of complexity.

Fear not, Web3-projects-looking-to-incentivize-Uniswap-V3-liquidity. A variety of teams are hard at work building solutions to simplify this process. Naturally, the team building xToken Terminal believes we’ve built the most secure, complete and powerful solution. However, we’ll still run through all the options that are out there in order to provide  you with the most complete set of information.

&#x200B;

[A basic summary of the feature sets for different Uniswap V3 liquidity mining options](https://preview.redd.it/mlof7idmqzr81.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=09bc06ac637d459b78e70425b6a8ac350fdf1017)

## xToken Terminal

Terminal is our new capital markets platform, designed to provide DeFi/NFT projects — and whoever else! — seamless and permissionless access to fundamental on-chain primitives. The first of these primitives is Uniswap V3 liquidity mining. Via Terminal, a Web3 project can have a [Uni V3 LM program up and running in a few minutes](https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/terminal/mining/create-pool). No dev work or Uniswap expertise required.

Pool sponsors select a liquidity pool and price range to incentivize, one or more rewards token(s) to pay out to LPs and an optional vesting period on rewards. Once the liquidity/rewards pool is deployed, sponsors can initiate a rewards program for any amount over any period. Once a rewards program ends, sponsors can initialize a new one. Sponsors never need to leave the Terminal UI.

Similarly, LPs never need to leave the Terminal UI. LPs do not need to mint an NFT position (the sponsor mints a communal NFT on pool deployment) or navigate to alternative UIs to deposit liquidity pool tokens. Data on staked balances, APR, pool history, etc are all generated permissionlessly and viewable on the Terminal interface.

Terminal is available on L1, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1n35slirqzr81.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45f728c5ca017d9d37900b75fdb3e58e2f4ba93

## Gelato (G-Uni)

Similarly to Terminal, Gelato also provides a fungible interface for a non-fungible Uniswap V3 liquidity position. While Gelato does not actively rebalance liquidity positioning, the protocol provides a  manager role on their contracts that allows a representative of a project to actively re-position if desired.

Gelato/G-Uni does not provide any infrastructure for staking rewards, rewards  vesting or rewards data. Projects using G-Uni tokens for liquidity  mining will need to deploy/configure smart contracts and build a custom frontend.

## UniswapV3Staker

The UniswapV3Staker contract is the most “native” option available to projects looking to sponsor a liquidity mining program. The contract requires LPs to mint a Uni V3 NFT position and then deposit it. Rewards are paid out as a function of in-range liquidity, i.e. the more trading volume your position helps generate, the more rewards you will earn. This approach may be the most rooted in precision, but in practice it has been [marred by manipulation](https://medium.com/@revert_finance/onetickdao-eth-and-the-narrow-rangers-f9a376f7f0c9) as well as a bevy of UX challenges. It also requires deep Uniswap V3 knowledge to fully understand. Lastly, we’re not aware of a full-feature UI for projects that wish to use the UniswapV3Staker contract.

Some community members have proposed a few modifications to the contract — notably a change that requires LPs to cover a minimum price tick range. This change is likely to mitigate some or all of the issues related to manipulation of rewards, however, it is unlikely to allay any UX challenges.

## Charm

Charm’s Alpha vaults rely on some of the most clever Uniswap V3 liquidity management logic that can be found in the space. Charm’s vaults rebalance in a way that avoids a direct swapping of assets, instead relying on single-sided pseudo-limit orders — a Uniswap V3 hallmark.

>Sidenote: many Uni V3 liquidity managers underestimate the slippage costs and gas costs of active rebalancing strategies, thus overestimating the expected value of a rebalance. Maximizing capital efficiency at a given moment does not necessarily lead to maximization of value.

Charm is soon to release a permissionless version of their vaults (Alpha  Pro). It remains to be seen whether their approach, which is well-tested and successful on high liquidity pairs like ETH<>USDC, will be performant — programmatically or otherwise — on long tail pools.

At launch, Alpha Pro will not offer the smart contract or user interface architecture for native liquidity mining.

## Gamma

Gamma pursues a more active rebalancing strategy, relying at least partially on off-chain logic that is not transparent to LPs. Though decentralization advocates may protest, there may be something to be  said for this more obscured approach, as purely on-chain rebalance strategies may be vulnerable to front-running or other forms of value extraction. Gamma is in the midst of remodeling their approach to liquidity management, so some elements of this description may no longer be accurate.

Gamma pools are not permissionless and there is no native liquidity mining architecture.

# A Note on Rebalancing

We at xToken have been demo-ing our new platform for a variety of projects in the space. We’ve been excited by the positive feedback we’ve received on the platform’s ease-of-use, configurability and  extensibility.

Several projects have asked us why we don’t offer the ability to rebalance  positioning in a pool. As the product currently operates, pool sponsors must set a price range at deployment and are unable to modify that price range (although deploying a new pool with new price range takes only a few minutes). While we are exploring methods of introducing this functionality, we believe that offering a rebalance feature on a permissionless platform like ours could expose our users to frontrunning and other forms of value extraction.

Why is that? We have experience with Uni V3 repositioning from our time managing [xU3LP](https://medium.com/xtoken/introducing-xu3lp-fungible-yield-f151c747131b), which for several months, was the largest provider of managed Uniswap V3 liquidity. It turns out that rebalancing must be executed very carefully, especially when the position in question is responsible for the lion’s share of liquidity on the Uniswap pair (this concentration of pool ownership is likely the case for many LM programs). In carefully researching management strategies for xU3LP, we witnessed many instances of LP rebalances being front-run by bots on-chain. In short, rebalancing large Uniswap V3 positions requires a level of expertise and sophistication uncommon in the space.

At the end of the year I decided to cover (or balance off) that capital loss by selling some crypto at a capitol gain. The transaction offset the capital loss protecting what would have been a taxable capital gain.

I’m not required to file a 1040 because my income was under the threshold. Apparently Coinbase (the bank that is holding my crypto) doesn’t report to the IRS. I have filled out all the forms but don’t know if I should send them in.

Will I still get credit for the offset if I don’t report it to the IRS in the year that it happened?",1,0

I've got some NFTs deployed on Rinkeby and I've sent them to a couple different wallets. My plan is I'll then distribute the seedphrases to each person, they can each install a wallet, put the seedphrase in, and off they go.

All the wallet softwares I've tried, however, either don't actually display the NFT or it's extremely clunky to do so. Metamask Mobile is the only one I've actually gotten my NFT displayed in, but only after importing the custom token. The UX of this process is ... not great for layperson, and I think most will lose interest if they have to go this far.

Are there wallets out there that will display NFTs just out of the box? Why is this functionality not default everywhere by now?",1,0

2022-04-06 12:10:59,txkpt2,Reddit has incorporated Ethereum based NFTs within its platform.,"Reddit, one of the biggest social network in the world, has incorporated ethereum based NFTs within its platform.

Four NFTs (pictured above) were sold for as much as $400,000 each to use as an avatar within the Reddit platform.

You can’t use your own NFT as an avatar. If you don’t have one of the four, you’ll have to just use a given jpeg.

The extremely limited NFTs available suggests this is probably just an initial test to see how integrating NFTs might work on Reddit.

This can easily be expanded by allowing people to mint their own avatar NFTs, either as a sale or just as a function.

Or you can use any NFT you have after connecting with Metamask as required by the platform.

Their function is then to just display them on your profile page which they might be trying to make more prominent in the new Reddit design.

It could also be just a way to get people to switch from the old Reddit design, which still remains very popular, to the new one.

Twitter has also tried to integrate NFTs as a profile picture, with it not too clear how that went as we haven’t come across many of them in the wild here at Trustnodes.

There are privacy concerns, especially if the user’s ethereum address is shown as Twitter does, because then you can potentially see someone’s wealth and their financial activity.

At scale, this can all be graphed to de-pseudonymize blockchain addresses, requiring significant care in execution to not basically open source your bank account.

A problem that OpenSea doesn’t have because the blockchain address is the username and the account.

Reddit and Twitter can also allow for blockchain accounts, with the user then giving it a nickname if they want, unless they’re comfortable with attaching their ethereum address to their real name.",3,0
2022-04-06 12:08:32,txkoai,CEO says that Starbucks will enter the metaverse business in 2022.,"On April 4, the billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, announced in an Open Forum that the company is planning to enter the NFT business before the end of 2022. This news was confirmed by the company itself a few hours later.

Although Schultz did not provide an exact date as to when the company would move into the NFT world, he assured that it would be “sometime before the end of this calendar year.”

Starbucks to enter the world of NFTs before the end of 2022
During his speech, Schultz asked the audience how many had heard about NFTs. He also inquired as to how many of them had been involved in NFTs or participated in NFT investments. Even though the room fell practically silent, Schultz explained that the ecosystem was young and that Starbucks had the best tools and collections to move into this new ecosystem.

“If you look at the companies, the brands, the celebrities, the influencers that are trying to create a digital NFT platform and business, I can’t find one of them that has the treasure trove of assets that Starbucks has from collectibles to the entire heritage of the company.”

Schultz’s new appointment as CEO of the company could bring an even more crypto-friendly Starbucks. It is important to note that other mainstream companies are not only sponsoring NFT drops but also creating new crypto experiences like stores in the metaverse or collaborations with other crypto projects.",0,0

2022-04-06 11:42:25,txk7ju,What do you think is causing the drop of ETH gas fees?,"High gas fees were previously the most difficult obstacle for investors using the Ethereum network; we had to use all of these solutions, whether L2 like Metis or Loopering, or others. Ethereum, on the other hand, has experienced a continuous fall in its gas fees, which have dropped by 90% in the previous six months and many of us feel relieved.

According to the crypto data intelligence platform, Santiment, the average gas fee on the Ethereum network is currently $5.81, 90% less than what was charged in November 2021. According to Etherscan.io, gas fees are currently as low as $3.17.

Just remember that last year on November 8, 2021, the average a user paid for a transaction was $62.85. In May 2021, gas fees hit their highest price of $69.In the last few months, I've begun exploring a lot more new marketplaces than I used to. Now, every month, I discover and use a new place, for example, last month, it was nOFTEN or SK8coin. As a result, it is not surprising that many analysts connect the increase in Ethereum gas fees in 2021 to an increase in the sales of NFTs on the Ethereum network.

Do you think that the migration of Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus model and the rise in popularity of layer 2 protocols are some of the reasons for the decline in gas fees?",9,0

I gotta admit that that strategy has worked pretty well so far.

2022-04-05 19:05:11,tx2dvd,Gensler Says SEC Exploring Shared Role With CFTC Over Crypto Platforms,"The SEC chief suggests securities and commodities “intertwined” in current trading venues.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said his agency is considering how to split oversight of crypto trading platforms between the SEC and the regulator of U.S. commodities, as most trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, Tycoon and KuCoin
include tokens that fit definitions of securities as well as commodities.

“I’ve asked staff to work with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on how we jointly might address such platforms that might trade both crypto-based security tokens and some commodity tokens,” he said during Monday remarks at an event hosted by the University of Pennsylvania’s law school.

Gensler said securities and commodities are “intertwined” on today’s crypto trading platforms, suggesting neither agency could act as a sole watchdog over such venues.

The chairman shared his customary suspicions at the conference, which focused on the future of crypto, saying all the recent industry advertising – including during the Super Bowl – doesn’t equate with credibility.

“There is lots of innovation, but plenty of hype,” Gensler said. “As in other start-up fields, many projects likely could fail.” I think this could have an impact on the cryptocurrency market.",0,0

2022-04-05 17:45:11,tx0m9m,"Crypto adoption among celebrities at all time high, making the market worse but introducing new people","Not fair to say that celebrity adoption is a bad thing, but a common theme of it is that it was always misconstrued, and that it gave people the wrong image about crypto and what it does, or the meaning it should hold. 

This is even more so the case in places like Indonesia and Malaysia. Celebrities and influencers in Indonesia seem to have become much more involved in Indonesia’s crypto investment industry since 2021. Many have become brand ambassadors for exchanges and crypto projects to help promote them and essentially raise the trading volume.

The participation of individuals such as Joe Taslim, an Indonesian actor that has gone global, and Indonesian models and actresses Jessica Iskandar and Shandy Aulia might not be surprising, considering celebrities’ inescapable presence in advertising and branding.
Some celebrities have even created their own cryptocurrency.
The trend of celebrity tokens has boomed, especially after one of the most prominent musicians in Indonesia, Anang Hermansyah, created his own token.

And despite the fact that celebrity adoption was somewhat helpful, it still was misleading to a number of users. Celebs, for example, did not venture within the field of DeFi tokens or DAOs or anything decentralized or on chains run by the people like the Lycan chain, but they instead always insisted in areas where they could maximize their profits, like NFTs. 

The celebrity token trend in Indonesia is neutral as long as they comply with existing regulations, because for the past couple of years, there are lots of Indonesians that created their own cryptocurrencies. But what I think is important for Indonesian developers to understand is that their cryptocurrencies must have values for investors and users and must have something that differentiate them from other existing cryptocurrencies. This is because they have a responsibility to their investors and token holders.",52,0

Be aware that people started to use search engines like LUDO or similar ones cause they function like Google for NFTs, we have plenty of NFTs on the ETH blockchain, they're the most popular ones so it's very hard to keep track of all these collections we have every single day.  


This has led to it becoming the go-to blockchain for many platforms that want to adopt those technologies. Ethereum, prior to the ETH2 upgrade, still utilizes proof-of-work (PoW), where miners contribute computing power to verify the transactions.   


One of the biggest social networks on a global scale, Reddit, has integrated Ethereum-based NFTs on the platform. Four NFTs were sold for up to $400,000 each to use as an avatar within the platform.
