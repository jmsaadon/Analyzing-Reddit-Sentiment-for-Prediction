The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, the increasing popularity of blockchain across a wide range of enterprises, and the potential for development in the blockchain industry all contribute to increased demand for blockchain and crypto capabilities.  


It's incredible how rapidly the promise of blockchain for improving people's lives and building more resilient organizations is being fulfilled by huge corporations and governments, rather than just a small hyper-technical group of IT professionals.  


Companies seek blockchain experts to assist them in implementing blockchain technology to meet their objectives. After doing an additional study into the blockchain industry, I discovered a few amazing firms about which I wanted to learn more.  


What I've learned so far, Duet Protocol is one of these firms, they're a multi-chain asset platform that can be utilized to construct a blockchain asset. I'm excited to see how this project evolves in the future!

There are literally thousands of shitcoin and coins that pretend not be be shitcoins much of whom are large cap not to name (ada) these coins have no specific use and mosly identify as ""peer to peer cash"" or ""smart contracts platform""

These are the reasons for why some people think crypto is a scam as ther are hundreds of coins claiming the same utility (not saying it is necessarily a bad thing)

Then there are the high apy's for stablecoins. do you really think that banks could ever turn a  profit by providing its costomers 20% apy s when the profit they make is 4-6% this is juat not sustainable sure there are mechanisms put it place and actuall cash to make sure it doesn't implodes but it will eventually happen as they cannot just pump cash infinitely

Crypto is just like the dot com bubbles loads of scams and company's ending there names in dot com to boost their share price

At the time of writing, ETH is just below this at $2680, where it has begun consolidating after yesterday‚Äôs crash.

ETH looks bearish on all time frames, with a slight bounce or consolidation likely on the 4H chart. Daily and weekly look very bearish, and a retrace to lower support levels is likely in the coming weeks. This is in line with BTC and other traditional markets, which have all been suffering as the world attempts to rein in spiraling inflation. These next few months will likely be painful, but will present good buying opportunities along the way.

Despite recovering from a 45-day bottom on April 30, Ether (ETH) remains trapped in a descending channel, and the altcoin's subsequent 9% gain over the last four days was just enough to push it beyond the pattern's $2,870 resistance. This might in turn have an effect of ethereum blockchain projects including play to earn game tokens like MANA and Sandbox and green efficient projects like Nature Vault and Cycled.

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy continues to have a significant impact on cryptocurrency values, and this week's volatility is most likely linked to FOMC statements. The Federal Reserve of the United States boosted its benchmark overnight interest rate by half a percentage point on May 4, the largest increase in 22 years. Despite being widely expected and unanimous, the monetary authority said that it would begin reducing its $9 trillion asset base in June. 

Chairman Jeremy Powell stated that the Federal Reserve is committed to restoring price stability, even if it means reducing company investment and consumer spending. Powell also downplayed the significance of the GDP contraction in the first three months of 2022.

DefiLlama data shows that the network's value locked in smart contracts (TVL) climbed by 7% in 30 days to 25.2 million Ether, despite the fact that Ether's price has corrected by 14% in a month. As a result, it's worth investigating if the price decrease below $3,000 had an impact on futures traders' sentiment.

Traders must examine the Ether futures contracts' premium, commonly known as the basis rate, to determine whether the market has turned bearish. These fixed-calendar futures, unlike perpetual contracts, do not have a funding rate, hence their price will differ significantly from conventional spot markets. 

The expense difference between futures and the ordinary spot market can be used to evaluate market sentiment.

Futures should trade at a 5% to 12% annualized premium in healthy markets to compensate for traders' deposits until the contract settles. Despite this, Ether's yearly premium has remained below this barrier since April 5, as shown above. 

Despite a little increase in the last 24 hours, the present 3.5 percent basis rate is considered bearish since it indicates a lack of demand for leverage purchasers.

Traders should also look into the options markets to rule out futures-specific externalities. The 25 percent delta skew, for example, compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options. 

When fear is prominent, this metric will turn positive since the premium for protective put options is higher than for similar risk call options. When greed is prominent, the 25 percent delta skew indicator shifts to the negative area, indicating that the market is overvalued.

A neutral area is usually defined as a 25 percent skew indicator range between negative 8% and positive 8%. Since April 16, the statistic has been above such a barrier, and it is now at 14 percent. 

Option traders are paying greater premiums for downside protection, implying that sentiment has deteriorated in the last 30 days. The market is currently seeing an increasing pessimistic attitude. 

Of course, none of this information can foretell if Ether will continue to respect the declining channel, which is now resisting at $2,950. Nonetheless, given the present derivatives data, there is reason to anticipate that any eventual rise above $3,000 will be brief.",0.053,0.834,0.113,0.9848,42,0
2022-05-06 18:21:14,ujts04,0.28635000000000005,"Ethereum [ETH] has the fuel, but can it skyrocket by the end of 2022",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"Finder organized a panel of financial professionals to produce an updated price estimate for Ethereum. Ethereum is expected to end the year at a high of roughly $5800, according to the panel. For many reasons, this is significant news for the Ethereum community. 

For months, the Ethereum community has been in turmoil. With the impending Merge with a slew of other soft forks, this year was predicted to be their year of supremacy. Ethereum, on the other hand, has failed to live up to the hype. From its all-time high in November 2021 to about $2800, the Ethereum price has declined by more than 43%.

In the last two years, though, Ethereum has performed well in other sectors. The DeFi TVL in Ethereum has climbed 82 percent over the year, from $49.1 billion to $89.5 billion, according to a Bankless analysis. This metric represents the value of assets placed in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges, money markets, and option vaults. 

The growing interest in NFTs, which are the largest created on the Ethereum blockchain (and includes play to earn game based NFTs like Bored Ape Yacht and Sandbox and; green efficient projects like Plastiks and Cycled), has also benefitted Ethereum. The total volume of NFT sales on Ethereum is $25.6 billion, which is significantly higher than the next four combined. 

However, the panel remains skeptical of Ethereum, citing the emergence of competing platforms during this moment of macro-turbulence. Finder's cryptocurrency editor, Keegan Francis, says,

""Ethereum is now at a highly insecure point in its journey. Ethereum is currently losing DeFi market share to its competitors, despite the fact that it still has a big lead.... ""I don't believe Ethereum will ever be a second cryptocurrency."" 

Joseph Raczynski, a panelist and a Thomson Reuters technologist, likewise warns that, 

""It (Ethereum) should be more safe, energy-efficient, and deflationary."" As a leading blockchain, if it isn't the trifecta of promise, I don't know what is.""",0.05,0.835,0.115,0.9545,21,0

In January 2022, a panel, that consists of 36 industries, predicted the price of Ethereum to be near $5,800 by the end of 2022.

Now, the panel has returned to a lower price prediction for Ethereum than it did in January, bringing down the target to just 10% above its current price.

This change in prediction was a result of emerging competition from rival blockchains communities like BNB, avalanche, Solana, polkadot, and Cardano.
Keegan Francis, Finder's cryptocurrency editor, said in a statement, ‚ÄúEthereum, currently, is losing its market share of DeFi to its competitors, although by a huge margin, it remains dominant‚Äù and according to Francis, he does not think Ethereum will remain the second-largest cryptocurrency forever.

Different altcoins are introduced to the crypto market almost every day, thereby leading to more competition in the market. Irrespective of the fact that some altcoins do not have any future potential, there are still some that look good.

There are some of the newly launched altcoins that look good and I've been following up on like Apecoin - up 9.0%, COIN - 6.59% with some Ethereum projects Bobcoin - up 10.57%, and Boji - 3.31% also looking good.

Francis also stated that he does not have long-term confidence in Ethereum until Ethereum upgrades its systems and accomplishes its promise to scale.

But what often upsets me is that since the announcement of the Meta project, I've been led to believe that our data and everything about us will still be available to everyone and that they will know absolutely everything about us with the assistance of Meta.   


Do you think that somehow blockchain could provide us security for that matter?  


As we all know, our data has been available to others since the moment we began using the Internet and social networks, particularly through the usage of social networks, where we give away nearly all information about ourselves.  


How do you feel about Meta and what do you think about how will it reflect on our privacy and data?  


While machines can manipulate information using logic and math, they cannot maintain or define value, which is why we call this the ""data problem."" Zenotta is the only platform I used for this cause, cuz it can turn any type of data or digital material into Smart Data.  


I must add as well that these things are cool cause if you're bad luck that your laptop tragically crashes, we're usually not worried about the hardware and applications, but about its data, whether they're images, songs, reports, movies, or anything.

You could do it through a digital currency and it'll take you seconds.‚Äù

Perhaps Buffett is comparing bitcoin to a stock? Or maybe he does not like that bitcoin does not provide passive income? After all, real estate brings rent, shares bring dividends, and crypto coins can only be resold. What a huge misconception!

Bitcoin can bring regular payments. Coins can be used for lending, farming, and staking. However, this requires smart contracts, which are available, for example, on the Ethereum platform. In the Bitcoin network itself, indeed, only the simplest functions are available.

Here are the popular options to earn passive income on Bitcoin:

* Lending/Savings Accounts

It is an analog of a bank deposit - you give away assets to make them work and receive part of the income as a fee for using your funds. Lending is the most understandable tool, it can even use ‚Äúpure‚Äù bitcoin. Naturally, you receive income in the same currency. Such operations do not require complex contracts: the coins are simply taken from your account for the duration of the ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù, and then returned. It is very important to choose to whom you lend funds. The most reliable options are large exchanges and well-known platforms. For example, the Binance exchange offers 5-6% per annum and [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) platform offers 15%. Be careful with higher rates!

* Staking 

Staking ""freezes"" some of your assets so that they work in the Proof of Stake protocol, where you passively receive new coins for owning the ones you already have. As a result, you earn income from the fees of other users. Staking is a popular tool, but for wBTC the choice is limited. For example, Celsius Network offers up to 4% income.

* Liquidity pools and yield farming 

Yield farming is when your assets are sent to the liquidity pool of a DeFi project. Pools provide operations with cryptocurrencies: they are filled with users' assets, and in return, they accrue income. To fill the pool, you need to deposit. When a platform's client wants to buy wBTC, your assets are taken from the pool. Instead, they add coins that the client paid with. For supporting the operations of the DeFi platform, you are credited with native tokens. They are traded in exchange and can be used for staking.",0.028,0.856,0.116,0.9913,13,0

There are several key features that make a token ‚Äúfundamentally healthy‚Äù, but what does this even mean?


 When a token is fundamentally healthy it means it is not just safe, but that it has the potential to be something successful. While some tokens may be technically safe, this does not mean that they will survive even their first hour of trading. Here are factors that come into play-



Transparency ‚Äî If you‚Äôre in a tokens chat room and the developers are not being transparent about things such as the tokenomics, goals with the token, liquidity lock, etc, it‚Äôs one of the clearest red flags to take note of in a new token. The same can be said for the opposite, as transparent developers build trust with their community and investors, creating a more solid foundation for a token to build upon. Know you can trust a developer by watching their transactions live with CoinScan‚Äôs Dev Wallet Tracker



Holder Distribution ‚Äî 99% of tokens have ‚ÄúWhales‚Äù, typically early investors that own large percentages of supply. Whales aren‚Äôt inherently a bad thing, however if 30% of a tokens supply is owned by 10 wallets while the rest of supply is owned by thousands, often just the 10 wallets will be able to make a token crash. Good holder distribution is not imperative, yet it is a green flag in the world of DeFi as no one person has too much affect on the price, ultimately leveling the playing field.



Good Liquidity ‚Äî Optimal token liquidity is roughly 15%-20% of its market cap, this way buys and sells don‚Äôt have a massive price impact, therefore making the token less volatile while stillTokens with tiny liquidity (less than 10%) are extremely volatile as buys and sells have marginal price impact, essentially ‚ÄúLeverage‚Äù in terms of trading. While these tokens may appear to ‚ÄúPump‚Äù harder, they can Dump equally as hard and are dangerous to throw large amounts of money into.



Good Community ‚Äî More often than not, communities are the primary driving force behind most DeFi tokens! It‚Äôs always good to properly analyze and access the strength of a tokens community by joining their telegram, reading their twitter, or even participating in it yourself. If a community is not welcoming to new members, how will it grow?

Ethereum started a major decline after it failed to surpass $2,970.

The price is now trading below $2,800 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

The pair could decline further if there is a close below the $2,700 support zone.

Ethereum Price Dives

Ethereum struggled to settle above the $2,950 resistance. ETH topped near the $2,970 level and started a fresh decline. There was a sharp move below the $2,900 and $2,850 levels.

Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ether price declined below the $2,800 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, there was a spike below the $2,720 support level.

A low was formed near $2,678 and the price corrected a few points. There was a recovery wave above the $2,720 level. The price even climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,969 swing high to $2,678 low.

On the upside, an initial resistance is seen near the $2,760 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,820 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,969 swing high to $2,678 low. The main breakout zone is now near the $2,875 level.

Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com

A close above the $2,875 level could open the doors for a decent increase, In the stated case, ether price might rise towards the $3,000 resistance.

More Losses in ETH?

If ethereum fails to gain pace above the $2,760 resistance, it could continue to move down. An initial support on the downside is near the $2,720 zone.

The next major support is near the $2,680 level. If there is a downside break below $2,680 and the recent low, ether price might accelerate lower. In this case, it could even decline below the $2,600 level.

According to[ Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io/), Otherside's smart contract has not been optimized. As mentioned by Twitter user u/WillPapper, the developers got so lazy to remove ready-made templates from the code that they left everything as is, leading to an increase in costs and costing users an extra $70 million.

Even though Yuga Labs implemented buyer verification and limited the first wave of land generation to 2 NFT per address, the demand still exceeded supply. This means that not everyone who wanted land from Otherside could do so.

Such hardships eventually caused market participants to compete, setting higher and higher fees in order to overwhelm each other's deals and become the first in line to generate virtual land. As a result, the average transaction fee was over 2 ETH (\~$5600).

Following the auction, Yuga Labs apologized for disrupting the Ethereum network and offered an alternative. According to them, the ApeCoin ecosystem needs its own blockchain to *‚Äúbe scaled properly.‚Äù*",0.064,0.884,0.052,-0.0827,1,0

This new investment category has enjoyed almost as much success this year, with an estimated 250,000 people trading NFTs on OpenSea each month.  


One business that has embraced NFTs is sports. And, as previously noted, these multiple benefits are best evident in sports, such as NFT match tickets, which allow committed fans to enjoy perks such as unique clips and moments of players, as well as other sorts of memorabilia.

Here is some statistic I find in this article: ""The Coinbase report also highlighted that Bitcoin is the king of crypto among U.K. consumers as it is the most commonly owned cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) is held by 52% of those surveyed with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Binance Coin (BNB) at 34% and 33%, respectively"".  


Crypto is becoming so popular, I heard that people worldwide are so hooked with idea that they can invest in companies with raising potential, all that hype Unicoins caused a few months ago, remember?  


But I always have that thought that even though our crypto community is large, there are even people who don't know anything about it or are not interested in this at all and they represent the majority of the population that thinks that way.

2022-05-06 06:59:19,ujhmju,0.29571000000000003,What is an ERC721? Learn about the basic characteristics of Ethereum collectible tokens,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"Coinciding with the notorious boom in the cryptocurrency market in 2017, collectible tokens became popular on the Ethereum network, which differs from the tokens that have driven successful ICOs, those attached to the ERC20 standard. In order to be able to issue unique and therefore collectible tokens, it was necessary to develop a new standard: the **ERC721**.

The prefix of the different Ethereum standards, ERC, comes from open proposals to collect comments from the developer community (Ethereum Request for Comments). The ERC20 standard, for example, requires tokens to be able to perform specific functions - transfers and validation, for example - and if a token's developer meets that requirement, the token can be handled by any application built to that standard.

Just by adhering to that standard, different tokens can then participate in a wide variety of smart contracts on the [Ethereum network](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development). This standardization allowed the creation of many tokens associated with various value propositions, and the initial offerings of the same contributed to the fact that in 2017 alone, close to 4 billion dollars were raised.

The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa collectible token , however, could not be realized with the ERC20 standard, under which all tokens are identical. This led to the [development of NFTs](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) (Non Fungible Tokens) or unique tokens, under the ERC721 standard . On the standard's own discussion page , the adjective 'non-fungible' is objected to, meaning that they are tokens that are not consumed, unlike ERC20 tokens.

The ERC721 was introduced at the end of last year. The proposal put forward by Dieter Shirley pointed out that these would allow smart contracts to function as unique tokens and that they could also be exchanged, the latter similar to ERC20.

Another important point is **the indivisibility of an ERC721 token** (half a cat is inconceivable) while all ERC20 tokens admit fractions up to one millionth. In addition, each ERC721 token has its own characteristics that differentiate it from the rest of the ERC721 tokens.

In October 2017, Canadian company Axiom Zen previewed the CryptoKitties game at a hackathon in Waterloo, Canada, which allowed cats with unique characteristics to be purchased, bred, and later matched. On the day of the official launch, December 2, 2017, the first cat in the series, Genesis, was sold for 247 ETH ($117,000) that day.

The game inspired other similar ones based on the same standard, although with variations in the allocation of unique tokens. In the case of kittens, users have a wide palette of characteristics or ""cat attributes"" (a 256-bit genome) that may or may not be passed on to the next generation. The total population of CryptoKitties cannot exceed 4 million felines.The success of this collectible character/part approach is based on a deep-rooted tendency for some people to collect physical objects, a trend that now extends to digital or virtual objects. While **not all collectible tokens are necessarily tied to the** [**Ethereum network** ](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development)\- the successful Rarepepes inhabit the Bitcoin network - the ERC721 standard is used in more than a hundred on DappRadar's list of distributed applications.

A lot of creativity is seen in developing these apps around collectible tokens. In the case of Etherbots, each robot created is a combination of unique tokens. In the Fishbank game, whose official launch was on Sunday the 18th, fish can be purchased -4.5% commission- or caught, they can even be launched into a fight, in which each bite increases the weight of the aggressor and makes it more competitive.

In the same way that blockchain technology is constantly evolving, and Ethereum is an emblematic case for the values ‚Äã‚Äãit adds compared to the pioneer Bitcoin, **the standards provide an additional source of innovation** . There is still room to take advantage of all the possibilities that the ERC721 standard offers in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtoken development.",0.014,0.913,0.072,0.9857,2,0

Not so long ago the Bored Ape NFT was listed for .08 ETH, that was more precisely in April of 2021, and now they‚Äôre trading for thousands of dollars each. My question is WHY?   
 

Since the beginning of the NFT craze, I've seen so many fantastic NFT collections, so many beautiful artworks presented as NFTs, so many great communities and NFT projects like SK8coin, and so many great NFT games. I didn't pay as much attention to these popular ones, such as BAYC.    
 

Pls, tell me what you think about it, and what do you think what's the main reason for this collection becoming so popular, like worldwide?   
 

What occurred to me is that because so many celebrities were involved in this collection, we can see so many celebrities with apes as their profile pictures on social media. Another reason is that they might be used as metaverse characters.   
 

But, in any case, they had the perfect timing, and they created such a boom when celebrities began purchasing monkeys.   
 

What do you think will happen to BAYC next? With Ape currencies and their metaverse, they have been developing their ecosystem. The popularity of BAYC is expected to expand in the future years.",0.017,0.745,0.238,0.9959,2,0

Do you consider that possible??  


The Ethereum chain is still one of the most powerful in the cryptocurrency business. This was the first chain to use smart contracts, and it remains the largest open-source platform for decentralized apps.  


The Ethereum chain, on the other hand, has struggled with limited scalability, decentralization, and a high gas charge.  


The most obvious example is the recent Bored Ape NFT sale, which increased the Ethereum gas charge to $3,300. Even a $25 transaction on the Ethereum network when Bored Ape NFTs were being offered would cost $3,300 in gas fees.  


I remember when I start using Ethereum I had no clue about all these issues, I was at first very disappointed lol until I start searching for these L2 solutions, now I use Metis which helped me a lot. What do you think is the best solution when it comes to these L2 platforms?

Seems to be focused on volume...which is a little disappointing imo. Bridges are there to facilitate sidechains and L2s and in order to mainstream ethereum we need to build vibrant bridges and active L2s. Would have been nice to see one of the biggest players help onboard more users who are priced out of mainnet AND maybe even priced out of bridging to L2 where they could thrive for much less in fees.

Luckily, if you are registered to earn donuts, the treasury is paying the bridging costs for you. Your donuts are on a cheap chain and from there you can go pretty much anywhere for pennies.

## Edit: what is Hop?

Hop is a bridge to send tokens between ethereum networks: mainnet, polygon, gnosis, optimism, arbitrum. 

> Hop is a scalable rollup-to-rollup general token bridge. It allows users to send tokens from one rollup or sidechain to another almost immediately without having to wait for the networks challenge period.
> It works by involving market makers (referred to as Bonder) who front the liquidity at the destination chain in exchange for a small fee.

Due to a famous bullish reversal pattern on its shorter-timeframe chart and a massive jump in ETH outflows from Coinbase, Ethereum's native token Ether (ETH) is poised for a small bull run above $3,000, chiefly due to a classic bullish reversal pattern on its shorter-timeframe chart.

Since late March 2022, the price of ETH has been forming a falling wedge pattern, increasing the likelihood of a breakout move in May and this particular affected Ethereum based currencies like AXS, MANA, QUINT and so on.

When the price moves lower inside a range indicated by two descending and contracting trendlines, it forms a falling wedge. 

These wedges resolve as the price breaks out of its range to the upside and rises to a length equal to the maximum distance between the pattern's upper and lower trendlines when measured from the breakout point, according to technical analysis.

The maximum height of a falling wedge is roughly $395. If the price of ETH closes over $2,850, the potential breakout point, with an increase in trading volume, the chances of it increasing another $395 to $3,150 are increased.

The Ether market's interim upside prognosis is supported by optimistic on-chain data. 

Notably, according to CryptoQuant, the quantity of ETH leaving Coinbase, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, reached an all-time high on May 3. 

Simultaneously, according to one of Glassnodes' on-chain measures, the ETH balance on all crypto exchanges plummeted on May 3 to its lowest level since August 2018. 

Both indicators point to a growing preference among traders for holding Ethereum tokens rather than trading them for other assets. 

They also correlate with a recent increase in the number of addresses with a minimum balance of 0.1 ETH, 1 ETH, and 10 ETH, indicating a recent resurgence in the upward sentiment of tiny Ether traders. 

The Ethereum balances tick higher across the retail addresses as Ether‚Äôs price trends lower, indicating that traders have been buying ETH at local lows. That further supports the falling wedge‚Äôs bullish reversal setup.",0.054,0.858,0.088,0.875,8,0

Among other platforms.

To start with the first would be Raiden, a payment channel system that runs on top of the Ethereum mainnet, has decided to expand its platform to the Arbitrum rollup, in search of economizing the use of this second layer solution.

The launch of this new enhancement was announced by the Raiden Network web portal, the organization in charge of the development and maintenance of the eponymous network.

Raiden is a scalability solution that is similar to Bitcoin's Lightning network, since it uses a peer-to-peer (or P2P) payment channel function, which allows streamlining off-chain payments.

Due to the nature of the protocol, opening payment channels in Raiden requires paying an opening fee in ether (ETH), Ethereum's native cryptocurrency. This limits usability due to the high fees paid on the main network.

As the release statement states, Raiden seeks in Arbitrum to solve that problem. In comparison, currently on the main Ethereum network commissions are around USD 5, while on Arbitrum, they are USD 0.6, according to the L2 Fees portal.

Arbitrum, is a rollup that is considered full-EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible), which means that it fully supports Ethereum's ability to execute smart contracts. Thanks to this, networks and platforms running on the main network can be migrated to these second-layer solutions.

The use of rollups is becoming increasingly popular. Vitalik Buterin himself, co-creator of Ethereum, has been one of the biggest promoters of this solution.

There are several obvious benefits for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, as well as how they may truly, drastically transform business processes.  


Have you ever thought more thoroughly of blockchain and its benefits?  


Just remember that so many companies started using blockchain these days. I've seen that Modex blockchain secured land registration, SMS frauds that telecommunication services are dealing with, health care records, and so on and on. Blockchain tech can be really helpful for so many things.  


Since blockchain data is public information and cannot be altered without recording the change, blockchain provides unprecedented security and traceability for transactions.  


Would you say that people will become more aware of all these benefits that blockchain brings and appreciate it more and not see blockchain and crypto only as a piggy bank?

As a result, it's not unexpected that a well-known fashion house like Gucci would begin taking cryptocurrencies at some of its U.S. locations.  


What was the most surprising thing you learned you could buy using cryptocurrency?  


It's interesting that Gucci stores will accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, among other digital currencies. Initially, I thought it would be Bitcoin or Ethereum.  


Do you believe that this is how the future will look, with more and more people using cryptocurrency as a payment method?  


I must state that crypto is clearly affecting the world, as seen by some things that amaze me. We may use it to pay for airline tickets, or we can invest Unicoins in companies with significant growth potential (Unicorn companies) and benefit from them.   


You can pay for meals with cryptocurrency in three ways: sign up for the BitPay Card, purchase restaurant/delivery service gift cards with cryptocurrency, and pay directly with cryptocurrency to a limited number of restaurants and delivery services that accept cryptocurrency.

Remember the first games that made a boom on the gaming scene?  Axie Infinity, Splinterlands, and Alien Worlds becoming increasingly popular, and this market sector changed drastically from its early days. What was your first reaction to these types of games and the whole concept of playing to earn?    
 

I was wondering since all these developed so fast, what will the future look like, what are your expectations? Is there something that you would like to change?   
 

Would you say that these games took NFTs to another level? I think that NFTs are most used in the gaming sector, somewhere I read about it, which is quite reasonable since all these games are NFT-powered.   
 

We have NFTs as gaming assets, which may be a gun or armor in a shooting game. I'm a fan of racing games, such as K4 rally, and NFTs might be, I don't know, a part of a vehicle or a car or something to modify your avatar in the game, weapon, magic, or whatever.   
 

This year, I expect that there will be an increase in the number of users, that people will begin to adopt this game concept more openly, and that there will be even more options for users to earn coins while enjoying a unique blockchain-powered gaming experience.",0.018,0.865,0.118,0.9697,7,0

People become aware of all its benefits and how can it improve various types of projects and businesses. So, it's no wonder that tourism started using blockchain more and more.  


Where did you find blockchain most useful, and for what type of industry?  


I was aware at first that blockchain is pretty important for data and files protection, I only had experience with Zenotta blockchain for protecting files, more precisely for converting any type of file into smart data, which was so useful, and from that example, I've seen that thanks to blockchain tech you can provide some type of protection for your data or files.   


So, it was only a matter of time before other industries would start using blockchain for that purpose.  


The Tourism industry could greatly benefit from the use of Blockchain technology. These include lower prices, customer loyalty programs, and more accurate reviews.  


I had no idea that we could now use travel platforms that provide greater transparency. They also allow tourists to submit comments on their trip. Locktrip and TravelChain are two Blockchain-based travel services, they're working on an internal system for controlling hotel bed inventories and other such things.

Profits and losses are dependent on the price action of the market you are trading. On Morpher you can open positions on stocks, cryptos, indices, and commodities.   


Our protocol augments and overcomes the limitations of the underlying market. Morpher Protocol consists of a set of smart contracts and an oracle service. The smart contracts are responsible for processing trades, managing Virtual Futures, and setting MPH Token balances. Where the Oracle connects the Protocol to live market data.

Since we have a team composed of both Russians and Ukrainians, we decided to create this side project to both help Ukrainians and raise awareness of how Russians are suffering from sanctions.

Morpher Arena will use blockchain technology to let investors trade virtual copies of sanctioned Russian stocks. All profits generated by the platform will be donated to organizations supporting Ukrainian refugees.

Russian companies, shareholders, and oligarchs will not profit from the trading, because users won‚Äôt trade real Russian stocks, just virtual copies of them powered by the Morpher Protocol.   
At the same time, Morpher Arena will also allow Russian investors to bet against (short) Russian stocks, something they currently cannot do on the Moscow Stock Exchange.

I'll continue to stack, stake and HODL ETH to the richest!!! GLTA!!!",0.052,0.801,0.148,0.6209,"Ethereum price to reverse the trend 

Ethereum price is in a medium-term ascending channel created by connecting its two higher highs and three higher lows since January 28. 

The third retest of the lower trend line has shown a bullish reaction ‚Äì lead cryptocurrency  BTC is recovering and influencing the rest of the market. Regardless of the bullishness, ETH needs to flip the 100-day SMA at $2,914 followed by the 50-day SMA at $3,069 to continue rising. This development is key to triggering a move that tags the 200-day SMA at $3,443.

While a move to $3,500 is likely, a surge in buying pressure could extend the run-up to the $4,000 psychological level.

On the other hand, a daily candlestick close below the weekly support level at $2,541 will indicate a resurgence of selling pressure and invalidate the bullish thesis. This could trigger a further crash to the $2,000 psychological level.

The previous candlestick was a hammer, and the fact that we're attempting to construct a shooting star indicates that the market is bouncing around in this area and attempting to form a very short-term consolidation range.

We will eventually break out of this short-term range and select the next course of action, but I believe we will need to see an impulsive candlestick to tell us which way to move at this time. Ethereum has many utilities including as a fuel to NFT projects like Little Esther, Plastiks which is backed by recycling data, Hydrominer which is about hydroelectricity, Cycled, Decentraland e.t.c and so it is a bound to enjoy a rise sooner rather than later. If we move to the upside, the $3000 level would be the first objective, which also happens to be the 50-day EMA. The enormous, round, psychologically significant figure will draw some attention regardless, and then there's the 200-day EMA on top of that.

On the other hand, a break below the hammer for Monday's session opens the door to a move down to the $2750 level, and subsequently to the $2500 level. Because the $2500 level has already seen a lot of support, I believe it will only be a matter of time before purchasers try to support Ethereum in that approximate neighborhood. A break below $2500 might unleash a new wave of selling pressure, which would most likely follow Bitcoin and other crypto markets. 

I believe we will see a lot of choppy activity at the very least, so I would be cautious about my position size, but as the market begins to move in the direction of a larger rally or breakdown, we can begin to put more money to work. In the end, I believe that the Ethereum market will continue to suffer alongside Bitcoin, but I do believe that we will see some support. The question now is whether we'll be able to achieve it here or if we'll have to dig deeper to locate it.",0.026,0.885,0.089,0.9672,35,0

Without it, it would be impossible to buy or sell anything of value. A market is only as healthy as the amount of liquidity it has available to it. Tokemak is a new type of DeFi platform specifically designed to create deep liquidity reservoirs and fuel the future of Web3 development. It defines itself on its website as a ‚Äúdecentralized market maker‚Äù and ‚Äúliquidity router‚Äù, offering projects a simpler and more efficient way to source liquidity. 

Tokemak is often referred to as a ‚ÄúDefi 2.0‚Äù project. DeFi 2.0 is not an official term, but is a colloquial term used by many in the community to differentiate between approaches. Traditionally, projects would attract liquidity by offering a governance token as an incentive. Issues would arise as emissions slowed or the governance token fell in value, and liquidity would leave to seek greener pastures. In the vast majority of cases, this method was successful at attracting liquidity, but a failure at keeping it. 

Tokemak attracts liquidity by offering single-sided vaults for users to deposit funds. These funds are then placed into LP positions, with safeguards in place to protect against impermanent loss. TOKE tokens are also paid to vault depositors as an incentive. TOKE can also be staked to control how the liquidity is deployed ‚Äì called ‚Äúliquidity directors‚Äù. This means that TOKE stakers are able to add liquidity for any token on any exchange, simply by holding TOKE ‚Äì making it a powerful token to possess. 

## TOKEnomics

The total supply of TOKE is capped at 100M tokens. 30M of this supply is allocated specifically as rewards emissions for platform users. This 30M will be slowly emitted over 24 one-month cycles. The rest of the TOKE is split between investors, team, individual contributors, core participants, and market makers, and is subject to a 12-month vesting period after a 12-month cliff. 

## TOKE Stats

* Total supply: 100,000,000 TOKE
* Circulating supply: 5,377,717 TOKE
* Holders: 4,704 
* Network: Ethereum

Tokemak is an innovative platform because it solves DeFi‚Äôs liquidity problem. Its token TOKE is a powerful governance asset that has the power to direct billions of dollars to wherever TOKE stakers choose, giving it massive inherent value. It is also a good product for the end user, who can experience sustainable yields with little-to-no impermanent loss risk.

2022-05-04 11:59:51,ui4x6k,0.29292000000000007,"Ethereum Price Prediction: $11,764 by 2025 and $23,372 by 2030",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"Fintech and cryptocurrency specialists recruited for Finder‚Äôs panel believe ETH will peak at $6,872 on average in 2022. This is $2,000 more than its previous ATH of $4,900. Then it is predicted to drop to $5,783 by the end of the 2022.

Finder's experts are more gloomy on Ethereum's long-term potential which includes being used as a fuel to more projects than it does with some of its projects being Plastiks, Hydrominer, Cycled, Sandbox and so on, than they were in the preceding study in 2021. The panel's average projection for the end of the year was $6,500 in January of this year. This is a 12% increase above their previous forecast of $5,783. 

Long-term, though, the average price prediction seemed promising. Ethereum will reach $11,764 by 2025 and $23,372 by 2030, according to the panel.

One of the most positive estimates for the end-of-year value of ETH came from Joseph Raczynski, a technologist and futurist at Thomson Reuters. He anticipates it reaching $8,000. He believes ""the Merge"" will contribute to the increase. 

""The Merge, an Ethereum update, is expected to take place this summer. This could have a huge impact on the token's value. This has been a long time coming for many people. It should be significantly more secure, energy-efficient, and deflationary. As a leading blockchain, if it isn't the trifecta of promise, I don't know what is."" 

Raczynski isn't the only one who thinks this way. The deflationary mechanism of ETH, according to 35% of panelists, will have the greatest positive impact on price post-Merge.

Another popular belief was that ETH's low energy use would have a significant impact on price, as predicted by 29% of the panel. The higher transaction per second of ETH, according to 16 percent, will have a significant impact on price. 

Asher Tan, the CEO of CoinJar, is optimistic about the future of ETH. He predicts that ETH will reach an all-time high of $8,500 in 2022, before rocketing to $35,000 by 2030. 

Tan is one of the 31% of panelists that believe ETH will face a supply shortage. This is assuming that no additional Ether is created and circulated within the Merge and Shanghai Upgrade. 

""The Merge is one of crypto's biggest and most important events - and one that has the potential to unleash an overwhelming supply shock to the system,"" Tan said.

Finder's global cryptocurrency editor, Keegan Francis, is an expert on the subject. Ethereum, he adds, is in a precarious position. Ethereum will reach $5,000 in 2022, according to Francis. It will be valued at $10,000 by 2030. 

""I do not have long-term confidence in Ethereum unless the network updates its systems and delivers on its promises to scale."" Nonetheless, I believe that people will purchase the token based on its buzz, promise, and potential. However, I do not believe that ETH will continue to be the second most valuable asset in the world indefinitely.""

Boston Trading Co's CFO, Jeremy Britton, agrees. SOL, MATIC, and other cryptos, he predicts, will overtake ETH. 

Carol Alexander, a finance professor at the University of Sussex, is optimistic about ETH's short-term prospects. However, she believes that by the end of 2030, ETH will be worth practically nothing. 

""ETH will become more important as De-Fi increases, but it will eventually go the way of all classic blockchain native coins as the new Internet of things technology develops ‚Äì think IOTA tangle ‚Äì towards the end of this decade."" 

Overall, 61 percent of the panel believes now is the time to invest in ETH. It's time to hold, according to 32% of the panel. However, only 6% of the panel believes it is time to sell.",0.018,0.895,0.087,0.9764,6,0

That is something I frequently think about, especially when I learn about some great ideas that function on a blockchain or are made possible by the blockchain.  


I was intrigued with how blockchain can secure our data, which has been a huge concern in recent years due to the prevalence of hacking.  


I was fascinated by Modex, which creates scalable products and services that employ blockchain technology to change the way data and digital assets are stored, exchanged, and managed, might be one of the solutions to this dilemma for huge organizations.  


However, blockchain technology continues to be a rapidly expanding area of growth for businesses in a variety of industries.

These two are among the finest investments anyone can make, but what about the next projects? Remember that ETH and BTC were unworthy at first, and look where they are today. So sometimes being patient really works out.   


I was completely stunned (in a positive way) to learn that I may use Unicoins to invest in corporations with great expansion potential and that the earnings earned by such investments will be distributed to all Unicoin holders on a regular basis as dividends. This initiative appears to be promising (no more pump and dump difficulties or scams!).  


We'd all like to discover a long-term investment and be delighted with the results, but the fact is that it's difficult to anticipate which of all these initiatives and currencies will be the best option. Especially now, when there are so many of these projects to choose from.

Do you use some of this blockchain protection to keep your data, files, and privacy safe?  


Every internet user should be able to select not just how their data and digital identity are utilized, but also which data they choose to keep private or public, and under what terms.  


With the rise of technology has come the rise of projects and platforms that offer data protection. For example, having Zenotta's blockchain that re-imagines digital ownership and grounds it in a legal framework is cool, it was about time that we had platforms like this that provide us with saving our data (whether it's a photo, video, or anything else).  


I think that's really great to know that we can now have all of that on a blockchain because, as data manipulation and theft become more common, these data sovereignty initiatives are becoming increasingly important for all of us who use the internet.

Could ENS Domain price skyrocket in coming months.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"Last weekend's big increase in Ethereum was caused by both a massive buying binge in the BAYC Metaverse and a massive buying volume of Ethereum Name Services. According to WuBlockchain, the most recent ENS-related purchase was a world-record-breaking deal.

The domain abc.eth was sold for 90 ETH, or about $255,000, according to the Ethereum blockchain explorer, making it the second-highest transaction in ENS history.
The reason for raising such a huge sum of money for a simple domain is due to the speculative worth of a domain that could be used by large corporations like Alphabet in the future. Domains containing the names of prominent firms, such as apple.eth or meta.eth, were created two years ago and will almost certainly attract record-breaking offers once the first purchasers arrive.

Blockchain technology in it's self is innovative , since the birth of cryptocurrencies giant Bitcoin and Ethereum we have seen the creation of diverse innovative projects catering to different needs in the blockchain ecosystem such as Decentraland an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land, Champions Playverse a decentralized and collaborative online casino which allows developers to build Games, Brave web browser that it gives its users the option to view ads or not , if users choose to view them, they will be rewarded with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT).

ENS Domain are innovative in that they allow Ethereum users to convert their addresses into easy-to-read names, much like normal domains do with IP addresses. Blockchain and non-blockchain resources serve as IP addresses, which users can transform into names such as Ryan.eth or Mike.eth. They can then share those addresses with others to receive donations or execute other Ethereum and blockchain-related tasks.
I am quite optimistic and I expect that in the coming months we would  see the sale of ENS Domains enormous increase as more people discover it's utility.

What Are NFT Packs?

The NFT Pack is a collection of non-fungible tokens packed into the¬†blockchain¬†for sale. This pack is unique to nft projects as it is animated. Digital trading card packs will be randomly distributed from all versions of the collection. With the NFT Pack, you will receive 1-8 Digital Trading Cards. At least one has a high rarity. In addition, blockchains like WAX allow users to bundle NFTs and use schemas to simplify the creation of NFT packages.

Non-fungible tokens can be bundled together and sold as a group at once. The actual trading card packaging at the retail store is represented by the NFT pack template. These digital trading card packs use animations to mimic the opening of a box and display artwork. Like a real trading card, you can buy it at trade fairs and collectible toy stores.

How Do You Buy NFT Card Packs?

Purchasing digital trading card packs is straightforward and needs the use of a digital wallet to complete the transaction. When purchasing an nft for the first time, digital wallets like as MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet are popular options.

Once you‚Äôve created a digital wallet with a seed phrase, you‚Äôre ready to purchase a trading card pack from an online retail storefront or a secondary market.

Where Can You Buy NFT Packs?

NFT packs have grown in popularity. Large sporting brands such as the NFL, UFC, NBA, and MLB have introduced these digital collectible trading cards to lifelong fans.¬†

1. NFT Marketplaces¬†

Some brands partner with a secondary marketplace like Atomic Hub using the WAX¬†Blockchain¬†to introduce these NFTs to their audience.¬†

* Spider-Man NFTs¬†
* Funko NFTs¬†
* Nickelodeon NFTs¬†

2. Branded Online NFT Websites¬†

Most brands in the nft space are creating their nft marketplaces, creating online stores to purchase non-fungible tokens directly. Here are a few examples:¬†

UFC NFTs¬†

For the first time, the UFC professional mixed martial arts team collaborates with crypto.com to launch nfts. Allows you to gather NFTs of championship fighters and UFC event contenders. Over 200,000 UFC digital packs were distributed, with the first round distributing approximately 100,000. After you‚Äôve opened the nft Pack, you may also sell these sports trading cards on their marketplace.

NFL NFTs¬†

NFT All Day has moments,‚Äô which are video snippets, photographs, and audio of professional football players on game days that have been turned into non-fungible digital collectibles. These collections contain all of the top plays and highlights from each team‚Äôs season. Email, social media, and¬†Discord¬†are used to advertise NFL All Day drops.

Basketball NFTs¬†

NBA Top Shop chronicles historical moments of the NBA‚Äôs best talents. These trading cards are available in a variety of media, including photos, video, and audio. The majority of branded enterprises are establishing an online shop to sell these digital artifacts over the¬†blockchain.

How To Open an NFT pack On The Blockchain¬†

These packets don‚Äôt have to be difficult to open. Some digital packs have a time limit on when they are accessible to open.

For example, if a drop occurs at 1 p.m. EST and you make a purchase within that period, they may need you to wait until 5 p.m. EST before you may open it. These time constraints assist to build buzz and allow flippers to sell an nft pack at a premium on a third-party site before it opens.

The following are the processes for creating a¬†blockchain-based digital trading card pack:

1. Opening Topps trading cards, go to ‚ÄòUnopened Packs‚Äô in your account.
2. Click on the nft Pack you would like to open, and a window pops up asking to ‚Äòconfirm‚Äô you‚Äôd like to open it.¬†*It‚Äôs essential during this step to be entirely sure that you are ready to open a pack because once you open it, you won‚Äôt be able to close it.* 
3. Click ‚Äòopen,‚Äô and the animation will begin showing the trading card pack opening. It will now convert that digital asset from 1 pack to the number of cards available within each Pack.¬†

As all new donuts will be distributed via the Gnosis(xdai) chain more and more liquidity will be getting added to the honeyswap pool thinning out the overall bonus for those providing liquidity on the chain that is already lower than the Uniswap bonus. Currently Uniswap LP providers who stake their donuts get 400k bonus donuts while honeyswap LP providers only get 200k bonus donuts. I would like to see these numbers swapped so honeyswap providers get 400k and uniswap providers get 200k. This would further incentivize people to use their newly acquired donuts to provide LP as all tokens are now distributed on gnosis and learn more about how defi works in the process.

Now, blockchain become very popular and useful to airlines. I've read that a handful of other airlines are experimenting with the introduction of blockchain technology in their loyalty programs. I think that can be very interesting for their clients and it could be a great way to promote the airline.  


That's how Singapore Airlines has been enhancing and expanding its blockchain-based rewards for its clients. I've even read that thanks to blockchain some airlines started selling NFT tickets for their flight and services.

Have you ever found yourself asking, ""Should I be investing in Ethereum?"" or ""Should I invest in meme coins?"" Or perhaps you've already invested in some and aren't sure what to do next? It occurred to me a few times, and these queries simply lead to further thought and confusion.  


The worst part is that we have is the fact that the crypto industry is constantly changing. Traders‚Äô interests change, infrastructure changes, and a coin can be immensely popular one day and disappear the next.  


I'm currently interested so much in Unicoins which would be invested in companies with great expansion potential and the best of these companies may be featured on our Unicorn Hunters show. If you watch it then you'll know how cool that show is. I'm keeping an eye on these coins and I hope that I'll soon decide what should I do, but I must admit that I'm pretty interested so far.  


You all know that there are numerous options available and that might be challenging at times. Especially when numerous altcoins are aiming to achieve the same thing or have ideas so large that they will take decades to fully comprehend.

Do you think it's possible?

I wouldn't be surprised if the amount would be even bigger since the popularity of NFTs in games is enormous and there are more and more of these games, as there are more and more NFT projects and platforms.

As I'm currently waiting for the SK8coin NFT project to come up I believe that every one of you is expecting some NFT project or collection to show up, so that tells you that there would be even more NFTs than we could imagine.

You can see from the pic below that gaming NFTs are the most common type of NFT to be owned and after gaming, there are profile pics, art, and others.

I can't understand how some people think that NFTs are just a trend, games are built with the NFTs as the main assets, digital artists are finally having a strong money-making tool in their hands, celebrities and powerful people are going crazy about them and there's an even greater cause, there are plenty of good things that NFT can provide to other people because it's been used in humanitarian causes as well.

So, would you still say it's just a trend? I don't think so.

Blockchain development has evolved by leaps and bounds, becoming the foundation of multiple markets as well as its own industry. The rise of blockchain developer enterprises, which come out of nowhere, underlines blockchain technology's promise.   
 

After understanding all about these thefts and attacks on personal data and files, as well as how blockchain might help solve these problems, I got more interested in Zenotta's ""Smart Data,"" which is likely one of the best solutions to this problem. With it, any type of file may be converted into ""Smart Data,"" and you as the owner have total control over your digital assets, providing you with protection.   
 

That's why many people believe that the next step for resolving this data theft issue is that there should happen the mass adoption of blockchain technology, which includes that every company should have blockchain as protection from data and personal information theft.

Even some major video game developers and publishers are entering the NFT industry with NFT games or reintroducing games that we have been playing for decades as NFT games.  


I understand that everything evolves and changes with time, which is OK, but does this imply that we will soon lose the video games we have enjoyed for so long?  


What do you think about that, are you okay with having only NFT-powered/p2e games?  


I didn't say I didn't like these games, cause K4 Rally is my favorite, and the gameplay, rewards, tournaments, everything about it is fantastic and I truly like it, but that doesn't mean I'd like Dota 2, which I've been playing since I was a kid, to become an NFT-powered game, no way!

So you might have read that users had to pay thousands of dollars in Ethereum fees to get an NFT that might be worth a few bucks. That happened that day, I saw that someone pay a $3500 transaction fee for a $500 NFT.  


I was shocked when I heard that the mint raked in more than $317 million for the company. It sold 55,000 NFTs at a flat price of 305 ApeCoins ($5,800 at the time of mint).  


I use Metis for quicker transactions and reduced gas prices and it's awesome, but this...This was a kinda different problem.  


Are some of you one of these people who had the misfortune to be at the wrong place at the wrong time?  


The overall process put a significant strain on the Ethereum network, which processed these transactions, driving increasing transaction prices for all projects on this blockchain. Some people were forced to pay hundreds of dollars for transactions worth only a few pennies apiece.  


Many people believed that Yuga Labs might have created a more effective smart contract to save costs after witnessing high gas prices. However, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin stated that even if Yuga Labs had improved the smart contracts, users would have paid more for NFTs.  


It's interesting in this whole story that the company also mentioned that it might look to migrate ApeCoins to its blockchain. What do you think about this, is this a good idea and do you think that will happen?",0.075,0.79,0.135,0.9687,11,0

The market is anticipated to remain under downward pressure at this point, as the $2750 level will provide support. If we break down below that level, the market is expected to continue to fall considerably further, possibly to $2500.

The 50-day EMA and the 200-day EMA are just above the $3000 level, which is further supported by the 50-day EMA and the 200-day EMA. As a result, it will be interesting to see how this plays out, given how the crypto markets have struggled in general and how strong the US dollar has been. Institutional money will be fleeing the Ethereum markets because they are so far out on the risk spectrum. It's tough to picture the crypto markets taking off to the upside as long as there are huge concerns throughout the world, and I believe there will be more misery ahead. As long as there is a dearth of interest, short-term rallies will almost certainly give selling chances.

The fact that Ethereum is still struggling to go forward despite fueling so many NFT projects including Decentraland, Sandbox and Crayon is adding to the challenges. Improvements to Ethereum appear to be taking a long time to arrive, and if that is the case, we will likely remain reticent to participate. The $2500 level beneath has historically served as substantial support, therefore I believe it is only a matter of time before buyers return to the market. However, I believe that many traders are viewing this through the lens of weakness, thus I believe it will only be a matter of time until we go short again. The markets will continue to witness a lot of erratic activity, but given enough time, they will settle down.

I think we have got a situation where rallies continue to offer opportunities to the short side. If we break down below the $2500 level, the market then goes looking to the $2000 level.",0.049,0.869,0.081,0.7033,12,0

Do you agree or is it too much of a stretch?",0.0,0.788,0.212,0.5106,"According to Business Insider, Geoffrey Kendrick, head of crypto research at British banking behemoth Standard Chartered, believes that the price of Ethereum can still achieve $35,000 in the long run.
According to Kendrick, the forthcoming switch to proof-of-stake will undoubtedly benefit Ether's price. According to U.Today, following a series of delays, the much-anticipated network upgrade is set to take place later this year.

To capitalize on increased institutional demand for cryptocurrencies, one of Standard Chartered's businesses revealed plans to open a cryptocurrency brokerage in July.
Bill Winters, the CEO of Standard Chartered, stated in October that bitcoin was here to stay. Because central banks are experimenting with their monetary policy, he said it was ""absolutely reasonable"" for consumers to invest in non-fiat cryptocurrencies.

In my opinion I think it is possible for the crypto
giant to hit $35,000 in the long run.  Cryptocurrencies are gradually breaking into mainstream as we have seen it gradually breaking into government and banking institutions and with an increasing number of countries adopting it.
Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain community are steadily breaking grounds with new innovative projects such as Decentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land, Faith tribe which is a platform for creating trading, distribution, and monetization of designs of fashion, Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology feasible. With continuous innovation like this the government and institutions wouldn't be able to ignore cryptocurrencies utility.
 In the coming years I think they will cryptocurrencies would be part of the banking and governing infrastructure. When this eventually does occur $35,000 for Ether won't be a stretch.",0.014,0.903,0.083,0.9517,68,0

Should the Crypto Ecosystem be thoroughly regulated.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0," Shavkat Mirziyoyev, the president of Uzbekistan, has signed a new decree that broadens the country's crypto regulatory framework. Its claimed mission is to advance digital technologies, provide favorable conditions for entrepreneurship, and strengthen digital legislation.

According to Forklog, which cited the document, the president's National Agency for Project Management has been renamed the National Agency for Perspective Projects. The NAPP will serve as the country's primary crypto regulator.

The regulatory body has been responsible with enforcing state policy in the crypto economy while also protecting investors' rights. It will also be in charge of bringing blockchain technology to the public sector and using cryptocurrencies to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and weapons proliferation.

Unauthorized mining and minting of 'anonymous' cryptos are prohibited by decree.
In Uzbekistan, only registered companies will be able to mine cryptocurrency. 

In my opinion I think Crypto ecosystem should be regulated as this would protect users like me.  There are a lot of cases of theft and scams that if left  unregulated would surely spiral out of control.
However these regulations should not be strict to the extent that they stifle the innovative nature of the crypto ecosystem, innovation in the current systen accounts for the the birth of projects like Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology are in demand, Solis an entertainment focused token harrnesing blockchain to facilitate, collaborate and connect creators and their communities that provide solutions within the blockchain ecosystem are in demand, Silks a Derivative Thoroughbred Horse Racing Game. 
My point is Crypto should be regulated to the extent that interest of everyday users are protected and platforms are held accountable for violating users interest but not to the extent that it stifles innovation and decentralization of the ecosystem.",0.044,0.853,0.104,0.9161,53,0

Do you think the Network can Surpass this Numbers in Remaining Quarters of the Year?",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"According to a new analysis by Bankless, Ethereum's revenues increased by 46% in the first quarter of 2022, from $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion. According to the research, the burning mechanism withdrew around 87 percent of the earnings, or $2.1 billion, from the circulating supply of ETH.

The network's EIP-1559 upgrade, which took place in August 2021, enabled the token burning mechanism. The ETH network's inflation rate ‚Äî a metric that quantifies the net change in the quantity of ethereum tokens ‚Äî decreased from 1.10 percent to 0.51 percent in Q1 as a result of this token burning process.
According to the data, the average number of daily active addresses increased from 507,662 to 529,018. The amount of staked ETH, on the other hand, increased by 111% from 5.2 million to 10.9 million. 

I think that is quite exciting to see Ethereum grow in value. This is more exciting when you consider the fact that there has been an increase in the adoption of cryptocurrencies by government and financial institutions around the world.  
I think that in the coming months we would see widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies around the world this  would cause an increase in the innovation in the crypto community and there will be much more innovative projects like Decentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land, Champions a decentralized and collaborative online casino which allows developers to build Games, Brave web browser that it gives its users the option to view ads or not , if users choose to view them, they will be rewarded with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT).

Still, most brands that established themselves on Ethereum don‚Äôt want to go anywhere. Ethereum is still where the money is, after all.

But, what if you could have the best of both worlds?

Here‚Äôs how Yuga Labs could have held a huge land sale that takes place on Polygon, but still settles on Ethereum:

**Step 1: Map the Ape token onto Polygon**

Difficulty: Easy, just reach out to the Polygon team.

Cost: Nothing

**Step 2: Deploy ALL of the ERC721 NFTs for sale on Ethereum, with all final metadata (not including reveal)**¬†

Difficulty: Medium

Cost: A few dozen ETH (chimp change for Yuga Labs)

**Step 3: Deploy an equivalent NFT contract with limited metadata (just tokenID). Then map your Ethereum NFT contract to the Polygon ERC721 token contract.**

Difficulty: Easy

Cost: Basically Nothing

**Step 4: Bridge 100% of your NFTs to Polygon, locking them in the bridging contract, and minting them onto Polygon.**¬†

You now have an Otherside land collection on Polygon!

Difficulty: Easy

Cost: A few dozen ETH

**Step 5: Deploy your sale contract onto Polygon.**

This Could be a dutch auction or a normal First come first serve sale.¬†

Personally, we at Aavegotchi recommend a bid-to-earn auction, leveraging GBM's fantastic technology (no hyperlink here due to spam filters, but look up ‚ÄúGBM Auction‚Äù

Difficulty: Medium-Advanced

Cost: Basically Nothing

**Step 6: Encourage APE holders to bridge funds to Polygon.**¬†

Explain to them that NFTs still remain on Ethereum. You‚Äôre just holding the sale on Polygon so users don't lose 100M in ETH gas fees. Maybe offer some incentives.

Difficulty: Medium

Cost: Bridge fees for users

**Step 7: Now that APE is on Polygon, hold the sale.**¬†

Users win items without spending 2 ETH in gas fees.¬†

Once the sale is over, users can easily bridge their tokens back to Ethereum and claim them for < 0.1 ETH.

\- Minted on Ethereum

\- Sold on Polygon

\- Claimed on Ethereum

...and that‚Äôs how you hold the world‚Äôs biggest NFT drop on Polygon, while still settling the NFTs on Ethereum, the value layer.¬†

Or you can blame Ethereum and waste 150M USD worth of gas.",0.095,0.782,0.123,0.9263,12,0

I believe that cryptocurrencies will be used in many enterprises, and we can already see them nearly everywhere.

Do you believe that these kinds of games may be a useful investment tool for everyone?  


Because we have multiple groups of individuals playing it, for starters, young gamers frequently earn and spend money while playing, assuring token circulation and demand. When it comes to market specialists, earn money by speculating on exchange rates, whereas investors invest in debt.

Experts on the Bankless podcast revealed some impressive statistics. 

Bankless, one of the most analytical podcasts on blockchain, crypto, and Web3, provided some statistics from its State of Ethereum Q1 2022 report. Almost every metric went up by orders of magnitude.

To begin, aggregated network hashrate and staked Ethereum (ETH) amount both increased 111 percent as compared to Q1 2021. Fees raised by Ethereum (ETH) network participants were $2.48 billion, up from $1.7 billion a year ago.

Because of the deployment of EIP-1559, the Ethereum (ETH) network destroyed $2.17 billion in equivalent, resulting in a 54 percent decline in the inflation rate. 

The most impressive data, however, comes from the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) group. Net trade volume increased by more than 19,200 percent, from $0.6 billion to $116 billion. The floor price of CryptoPunks has more than sixfold increased.

A number of records were also printed as a result of trading on decentralized exchanges. The net volume of perpetual contracts on Ethereum-based DEXes increased by more than 2,700%, while spot trading volume increased by 667%. 

The total amount of assets locked (TVL) across Ethereum-based Layer 2 solutions, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, has climbed by 964 percent.

2022-05-01 19:38:20,ug7k76,0.50909,"Analysts are optimistic about Ethereum, which has 12 million ETH staked on the consensus layer.",0.0,0.859,0.141,0.3182,"12 million ETH tokens have now been staked on the consensus layer, marking a significant achievement for the altcoin. 

Proponents feel that a big amount of Ethereum staked is a bullish indicator that might fuel an altcoin boom. 

As the altcoin gained popularity among users, Ethereum's revenue surged 46 percent in Q1 2022.

Ethereum price volatility has increased uncertainty among investors. However, analysts are bullish on Ethereum and predict a rally in the altcoin. 

The Ethereum consensus layer has now been staked with 12 million ETH tokens. A boost in Ethereum's staked supply reduces its circulating supply. A decrease in circulating supply is positive for the altcoin's price. 

After experiencing price fluctuation, Ethereum, one of the most valuable crypto and the fuel to so many blockchain projects which include Crayon Dao whose subsidiaries, Heritage Dao and High Sloth Society give investors opportunities to buy ancient artefacts, Ancient Artefacts NFT and Bequest NFT; is on course to recoup its losses. According to Glassnode data, the exchange netflow volume is 6,244 ETH. This indicates that investors have a bullish leaning.

Proponents say investors are positive about Ethereum as a result of the long-awaited merger. The consensus layer deposit contract recently topped 12 million ETH tokens in circulation, accounting for more over 10% of the total ETH supply in circulation. 

$34 billion in ETH has been extracted from Ethereum's circulating supply, with over 376,000 validators contributing to the same in transactions worth 32 ETH or more. Analysts predict the price of Ethereum will above the 55-day simple moving average (SMA), a critical level for confirming a bullish bias. 

Analysts have highlighted $3,018.55 as a significant resistance level for bulls attempting to recover. Analysts have set a downside target of $2,695.79 if the price of Ethereum falls below $2,800.",0.035,0.87,0.095,0.9545,4,0

The upcoming Ethereum merge is one of the most widely discussed topics in the crypto sector, one including Bitcoin, Ripple, Doge, Champs e.t.c and analysts have a wide range of perspectives on how the transition to proof of stake could impact Ether's price. 

A deeper dive into the ongoing accumulation of Ether by whale wallets was provided by cryptocurrency intelligence firm Jarvis Labs, which posted the following chart looking at the percentage change in whale wallet holdings versus ET price. 

The color of the dots corresponds to the price of Ether, and the chart shows that whale wallets began to reduce their holdings when the price was above $4,000, and they did not begin to reaccumulate until the price dropped below $2,300.

According to Jarvis Labs, 

""Whales are still accumulating Ether, and their accumulation is still on a sideways-to-uptrend."" 
And it's not only whales eager to scoop up Ether on the cheap, as illustrated in the graphic below, where red dots indicate a rise in accumulation in both whale wallets and lesser wallets.

Jarvis Labs analysts stated, 

""Based solely on the distributions of Ether wallets, it can be deduced that Whales UP + Fishes UP"" (Both whales and Fishes seem to be accumulating). ""How about combining narratives?"" 
Is a decoupling of Ethereum on the horizon? 

Delphi Digital analysts wondered if the price of Ethereum could decouple from BTC before or after the merger. According to the analysts, the altcoin is ""expected to witness additional consolidation for ETH/BTC in the short future.""

One of the key concerns raised by this chart is what it will take for Ether to break free from ""the invisible link"" that has held it tethered to Bitcoin for so long. 

According to Delphi Digital, the current optimistic ""ultrasound money"" and ""Merge"" narratives around Ether could be just what Ether needs to break free from its price correlation to Bitcoin.

Last September, the leading British investment bank declared the overly optimistic aim for the first time. The bitcoin market was gearing up to begin another huge climb following a minor dip at the time. 

Kendrick predicted Bitcoin, Ethereum, Crayon and so many other cryptos and said that Bitcoin would reach a top of roughly $100,000 in early 2022 in September. While Bitcoin did reach a new all-time high of $69,000 in November, it subsequently began a bearish cycle prompted by macroeconomic variables. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency is trading just below the $39,000 mark, underperforming together with US Stocks.

Despite the selloff, institutional money is still flowing into crypto, according to Standard Chartered's chief crypto researcher. 

According to Kendrick, the forthcoming switch to proof-of-stake will undoubtedly enhance the price of Ether. According to U.Today, the much-anticipated network upgrade of Ethereum is set to take place later this year, following a series of delays. 

The analyst also singled out Avalanche and Polkadot as the biggest Ethereum rivals, passing over Solana. 

In July, one of Standard Chartered's businesses revealed plans to launch a cryptocurrency brokerage to capitalize on surging institutional demand for cryptocurrencies.

In October, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters said that crypto was here to stay. He said that it was ""perfectly reasonable"" for people to invest in non-fiat cryptocurrencies due to central banks experimenting with their monetary policy.",0.006,0.937,0.058,0.8979,46,0

If we accept we can‚Äôt time the market and on balance it is better to just be in the market for the long term then is DCA bad advice? 

Does it make even less sense when inflation is just eating away at your dollars that you have sidelined to DCA?

Seems to me you just decide how much you want to invest and then choose a point where you say you are all in. On average, you are likely to buy higher with DCA as the long-term trend is up‚Ä¶. 

Is DCA simply a way to cater for loss aversion. We are happy to buy higher  than we are to see price go down after we bought.

The producers behind Fortress Festival have launched DeFy Tickets, a new NFT blockchain ticketing platform. Available to United States ticket buyers, DeFy offers digital smart tickets that can be bought and sold as NFTs on the Polygon Blockchain.  


What I really find cool when it comes to NFT tickets is that they allow artists to prevent the loss of revenue that occurs via the secondary market. That's a possibility for technology to create a more fair, transparent, and secure distribution of value to event organizers, artists, and fans. NFT TiX is really trying to bring close these new ways of ticketing to users and I truly hope that we will all get used to this ticketing system as soon as possible.

Blockchains are not all the same. If the consensus mechanism is not entirely decentralized, or if full nodes have the power to reverse or censor transactions, the same concerns as in traditional systems will arise.

In my opinion, standards must also be defined because there are now numerous distinct blockchain protocols competing with one another.

I would like to see these numbers swapped so honey swap providers get 400k and uniswap providers get 200k. This would further incentivize people to use their newly acquired donuts to provide LP as all tokens are now distributed on gnosis and learn more about how defi works in the process.

Every one of these potential advantages is accessible with ETH, and I've seen that a growing number of businesses are already accepting ETH payments.  


When it comes to NFTs, we may buy them with ETH and use them to pay for other services provided by other projects and markets, such as SK8coin or any other that accepts ETH.  


Must mention that I did not use ETH to directly pay for anything. When we take a closer look, we can see that we are already using ETH to pay for a range of things, even when we exclude the tokens we purchase for future payments.

On the other hand, NFTs help artists overcome this critical issue by ensuring ownership of each digital production - an NFT owner owns just the token itself, not the underlying item or any related copyright.  


Whether you believe the hype or not, NFTs are going to change the art industry, affecting not just how art is acquired and sold, but also what kind of art we value and whose artists we support.  


NFT markets are the answer to making NFT artworks. Users may mint NFT by uploading their digital artwork to the marketplace site.  


Would you believe that NFTs will alter the current art market trading mechanism, particularly for digital art?  


Yet, of course, there are many different kinds of marketplaces. Because I've been skating my entire life, I'd absolutely put my NFT on a Sk8coin if it had anything to do with skateboarding. They assist skaters, sports teams, artists, and others. As you can see, there are a variety of options for minting and submitting your NFT artwork.

There have been several malversations and thefts, particularly since the popularity of cryptocurrencies began to rise, and we must secure our data and exercise extreme caution.

The threat to Internet security is a key hurdle to electronic transactions through the Internet medium.  


Many CEOs are puzzled by the current popularity and possible profitability of internet commerce. Connecting to the Internet and expanding their business would, in other words, expose them to dangers and threats of invasion.

This was the first chain to incorporate smart contracts, and it is still the largest open-source platform for decentralized apps.   


ETH is used for every possible transaction, whether we're directly paying with ETH or purchasing some of these tokens that give us additional payment for marketplaces.  


So, dealing with high gas prices and delayed transactions is crucial from the start. Do you recall when the Ethereum gas fee once hit $50?  


I remember when I first started using ETH, I had no clue about any of these issues, and I was pretty frustrated at first until I started looking for these L2 solutions or applications that analyze the pending transactions on the mainnet Ethererum, and now I use Metis, which helped me a lot.
