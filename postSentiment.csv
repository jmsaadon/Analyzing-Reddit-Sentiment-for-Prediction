It's incredible how rapidly the promise of blockchain for improving people's lives and building more resilient organizations is being fulfilled by huge corporations and governments, rather than just a small hyper-technical group of IT professionals.  


Companies seek blockchain experts to assist them in implementing blockchain technology to meet their objectives. After doing an additional study into the blockchain industry, I discovered a few amazing firms about which I wanted to learn more.  


What I've learned so far, Duet Protocol is one of these firms, they're a multi-chain asset platform that can be utilized to construct a blockchain asset. I'm excited to see how this project evolves in the future!

Despite recovering from a 45-day bottom on April 30, Ether (ETH) remains trapped in a descending channel, and the altcoin's subsequent 9% gain over the last four days was just enough to push it beyond the pattern's $2,870 resistance. This might in turn have an effect of ethereum blockchain projects including play to earn game tokens like MANA and Sandbox and green efficient projects like Nature Vault and Cycled.

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy continues to have a significant impact on cryptocurrency values, and this week's volatility is most likely linked to FOMC statements. The Federal Reserve of the United States boosted its benchmark overnight interest rate by half a percentage point on May 4, the largest increase in 22 years. Despite being widely expected and unanimous, the monetary authority said that it would begin reducing its $9 trillion asset base in June. 

Chairman Jeremy Powell stated that the Federal Reserve is committed to restoring price stability, even if it means reducing company investment and consumer spending. Powell also downplayed the significance of the GDP contraction in the first three months of 2022.

DefiLlama data shows that the network's value locked in smart contracts (TVL) climbed by 7% in 30 days to 25.2 million Ether, despite the fact that Ether's price has corrected by 14% in a month. As a result, it's worth investigating if the price decrease below $3,000 had an impact on futures traders' sentiment.

Traders must examine the Ether futures contracts' premium, commonly known as the basis rate, to determine whether the market has turned bearish. These fixed-calendar futures, unlike perpetual contracts, do not have a funding rate, hence their price will differ significantly from conventional spot markets. 

The expense difference between futures and the ordinary spot market can be used to evaluate market sentiment.

Futures should trade at a 5% to 12% annualized premium in healthy markets to compensate for traders' deposits until the contract settles. Despite this, Ether's yearly premium has remained below this barrier since April 5, as shown above. 

Despite a little increase in the last 24 hours, the present 3.5 percent basis rate is considered bearish since it indicates a lack of demand for leverage purchasers.

Traders should also look into the options markets to rule out futures-specific externalities. The 25 percent delta skew, for example, compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options. 

When fear is prominent, this metric will turn positive since the premium for protective put options is higher than for similar risk call options. When greed is prominent, the 25 percent delta skew indicator shifts to the negative area, indicating that the market is overvalued.

A neutral area is usually defined as a 25 percent skew indicator range between negative 8% and positive 8%. Since April 16, the statistic has been above such a barrier, and it is now at 14 percent. 

Option traders are paying greater premiums for downside protection, implying that sentiment has deteriorated in the last 30 days. The market is currently seeing an increasing pessimistic attitude. 

Of course, none of this information can foretell if Ether will continue to respect the declining channel, which is now resisting at $2,950. Nonetheless, given the present derivatives data, there is reason to anticipate that any eventual rise above $3,000 will be brief.",0.053,0.834,0.113,0.9848,42,0

In January 2022, a panel, that consists of 36 industries, predicted the price of Ethereum to be near $5,800 by the end of 2022.

Now, the panel has returned to a lower price prediction for Ethereum than it did in January, bringing down the target to just 10% above its current price.

This change in prediction was a result of emerging competition from rival blockchains communities like BNB, avalanche, Solana, polkadot, and Cardano.
Keegan Francis, Finder's cryptocurrency editor, said in a statement, “Ethereum, currently, is losing its market share of DeFi to its competitors, although by a huge margin, it remains dominant” and according to Francis, he does not think Ethereum will remain the second-largest cryptocurrency forever.

Different altcoins are introduced to the crypto market almost every day, thereby leading to more competition in the market. Irrespective of the fact that some altcoins do not have any future potential, there are still some that look good.

There are some of the newly launched altcoins that look good and I've been following up on like Apecoin - up 9.0%, COIN - 6.59% with some Ethereum projects Bobcoin - up 10.57%, and Boji - 3.31% also looking good.

Francis also stated that he does not have long-term confidence in Ethereum until Ethereum upgrades its systems and accomplishes its promise to scale.

We can agree with this - the value of BTC is supported mainly by the interest of investors, but just like the currency that exists as long as people believe in it. In this situation, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon rightly said: “Not all of it is bad. If you said to me ‘I want to send $200 to a friend in a foreign country,’ that could take you two weeks and cost you $40. You could do it through a digital currency and it'll take you seconds.”

Perhaps Buffett is comparing bitcoin to a stock? Or maybe he does not like that bitcoin does not provide passive income? After all, real estate brings rent, shares bring dividends, and crypto coins can only be resold. What a huge misconception!

Bitcoin can bring regular payments. Coins can be used for lending, farming, and staking. However, this requires smart contracts, which are available, for example, on the Ethereum platform. In the Bitcoin network itself, indeed, only the simplest functions are available.

Here are the popular options to earn passive income on Bitcoin:

* Lending/Savings Accounts

It is an analog of a bank deposit - you give away assets to make them work and receive part of the income as a fee for using your funds. Lending is the most understandable tool, it can even use “pure” bitcoin. Naturally, you receive income in the same currency. Such operations do not require complex contracts: the coins are simply taken from your account for the duration of the “deposit”, and then returned. It is very important to choose to whom you lend funds. The most reliable options are large exchanges and well-known platforms. For example, the Binance exchange offers 5-6% per annum and [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) platform offers 15%. Be careful with higher rates!

* Staking 

Staking ""freezes"" some of your assets so that they work in the Proof of Stake protocol, where you passively receive new coins for owning the ones you already have. As a result, you earn income from the fees of other users. Staking is a popular tool, but for wBTC the choice is limited. For example, Celsius Network offers up to 4% income.

* Liquidity pools and yield farming 

Yield farming is when your assets are sent to the liquidity pool of a DeFi project. Pools provide operations with cryptocurrencies: they are filled with users' assets, and in return, they accrue income. To fill the pool, you need to deposit. When a platform's client wants to buy wBTC, your assets are taken from the pool. Instead, they add coins that the client paid with. For supporting the operations of the DeFi platform, you are credited with native tokens. They are traded in exchange and can be used for staking.",0.028,0.856,0.116,0.9913,13,0

There are several key features that make a token “fundamentally healthy”, but what does this even mean?


 When a token is fundamentally healthy it means it is not just safe, but that it has the potential to be something successful. While some tokens may be technically safe, this does not mean that they will survive even their first hour of trading. Here are factors that come into play-



Transparency — If you’re in a tokens chat room and the developers are not being transparent about things such as the tokenomics, goals with the token, liquidity lock, etc, it’s one of the clearest red flags to take note of in a new token. The same can be said for the opposite, as transparent developers build trust with their community and investors, creating a more solid foundation for a token to build upon. Know you can trust a developer by watching their transactions live with CoinScan’s Dev Wallet Tracker



Holder Distribution — 99% of tokens have “Whales”, typically early investors that own large percentages of supply. Whales aren’t inherently a bad thing, however if 30% of a tokens supply is owned by 10 wallets while the rest of supply is owned by thousands, often just the 10 wallets will be able to make a token crash. Good holder distribution is not imperative, yet it is a green flag in the world of DeFi as no one person has too much affect on the price, ultimately leveling the playing field.



Good Liquidity — Optimal token liquidity is roughly 15%-20% of its market cap, this way buys and sells don’t have a massive price impact, therefore making the token less volatile while stillTokens with tiny liquidity (less than 10%) are extremely volatile as buys and sells have marginal price impact, essentially “Leverage” in terms of trading. While these tokens may appear to “Pump” harder, they can Dump equally as hard and are dangerous to throw large amounts of money into.



Good Community — More often than not, communities are the primary driving force behind most DeFi tokens! It’s always good to properly analyze and access the strength of a tokens community by joining their telegram, reading their twitter, or even participating in it yourself. If a community is not welcoming to new members, how will it grow?

According to[ Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io/), Otherside's smart contract has not been optimized. As mentioned by Twitter user u/WillPapper, the developers got so lazy to remove ready-made templates from the code that they left everything as is, leading to an increase in costs and costing users an extra $70 million.

Even though Yuga Labs implemented buyer verification and limited the first wave of land generation to 2 NFT per address, the demand still exceeded supply. This means that not everyone who wanted land from Otherside could do so.

Such hardships eventually caused market participants to compete, setting higher and higher fees in order to overwhelm each other's deals and become the first in line to generate virtual land. As a result, the average transaction fee was over 2 ETH (\~$5600).

Following the auction, Yuga Labs apologized for disrupting the Ethereum network and offered an alternative. According to them, the ApeCoin ecosystem needs its own blockchain to *“be scaled properly.”*",0.064,0.884,0.052,-0.0827,1,0

The third retest of the lower trend line has shown a bullish reaction – lead cryptocurrency  BTC is recovering and influencing the rest of the market. Regardless of the bullishness, ETH needs to flip the 100-day SMA at $2,914 followed by the 50-day SMA at $3,069 to continue rising. This development is key to triggering a move that tags the 200-day SMA at $3,443.

While a move to $3,500 is likely, a surge in buying pressure could extend the run-up to the $4,000 psychological level.

2022-05-04 18:18:15,uicy05,0.52816,ETH/USD Forecast: Ethereum Gives Up Early Gains,0.0,0.714,0.286,0.34,"As we continue to hover around the $2800 level, the Ethereum market tried to rally but gave back early gains. The previous candlestick was a hammer, and the fact that we're attempting to construct a shooting star indicates that the market is bouncing around in this area and attempting to form a very short-term consolidation range.

We will eventually break out of this short-term range and select the next course of action, but I believe we will need to see an impulsive candlestick to tell us which way to move at this time. Ethereum has many utilities including as a fuel to NFT projects like Little Esther, Plastiks which is backed by recycling data, Hydrominer which is about hydroelectricity, Cycled, Decentraland e.t.c and so it is a bound to enjoy a rise sooner rather than later. If we move to the upside, the $3000 level would be the first objective, which also happens to be the 50-day EMA. The enormous, round, psychologically significant figure will draw some attention regardless, and then there's the 200-day EMA on top of that.

On the other hand, a break below the hammer for Monday's session opens the door to a move down to the $2750 level, and subsequently to the $2500 level. Because the $2500 level has already seen a lot of support, I believe it will only be a matter of time before purchasers try to support Ethereum in that approximate neighborhood. A break below $2500 might unleash a new wave of selling pressure, which would most likely follow Bitcoin and other crypto markets. 

I believe we will see a lot of choppy activity at the very least, so I would be cautious about my position size, but as the market begins to move in the direction of a larger rally or breakdown, we can begin to put more money to work. In the end, I believe that the Ethereum market will continue to suffer alongside Bitcoin, but I do believe that we will see some support.

That is something I frequently think about, especially when I learn about some great ideas that function on a blockchain or are made possible by the blockchain.  


I was intrigued with how blockchain can secure our data, which has been a huge concern in recent years due to the prevalence of hacking.  


I was fascinated by Modex, which creates scalable products and services that employ blockchain technology to change the way data and digital assets are stored, exchanged, and managed, might be one of the solutions to this dilemma for huge organizations.

These two are among the finest investments anyone can make, but what about the next projects? Remember that ETH and BTC were unworthy at first, and look where they are today. So sometimes being patient really works out.   


I was completely stunned (in a positive way) to learn that I may use Unicoins to invest in corporations with great expansion potential and that the earnings earned by such investments will be distributed to all Unicoin holders on a regular basis as dividends. This initiative appears to be promising (no more pump and dump difficulties or scams!).

Every internet user should be able to select not just how their data and digital identity are utilized, but also which data they choose to keep private or public, and under what terms.  


With the rise of technology has come the rise of projects and platforms that offer data protection. For example, having Zenotta's blockchain that re-imagines digital ownership and grounds it in a legal framework is cool, it was about time that we had platforms like this that provide us with saving our data (whether it's a photo, video, or anything else).  


I think that's really great to know that we can now have all of that on a blockchain because, as data manipulation and theft become more common, these data sovereignty initiatives are becoming increasingly important for all of us who use the internet.

Bankless, one of the most analytical podcasts on blockchain, crypto, and Web3, provided some statistics from its State of Ethereum Q1 2022 report. Almost every metric went up by orders of magnitude.

Because of the deployment of EIP-1559, the Ethereum (ETH) network destroyed $2.17 billion in equivalent, resulting in a 54 percent decline in the inflation rate.

Proponents feel that a big amount of Ethereum staked is a bullish indicator that might fuel an altcoin boom. 

As the altcoin gained popularity among users, Ethereum's revenue surged 46 percent in Q1 2022.

Ethereum price volatility has increased uncertainty among investors. However, analysts are bullish on Ethereum and predict a rally in the altcoin. 

The Ethereum consensus layer has now been staked with 12 million ETH tokens. A boost in Ethereum's staked supply reduces its circulating supply. A decrease in circulating supply is positive for the altcoin's price. 

After experiencing price fluctuation, Ethereum, one of the most valuable crypto and the fuel to so many blockchain projects which include Crayon Dao whose subsidiaries, Heritage Dao and High Sloth Society give investors opportunities to buy ancient artefacts, Ancient Artefacts NFT and Bequest NFT; is on course to recoup its losses. According to Glassnode data, the exchange netflow volume is 6,244 ETH. This indicates that investors have a bullish leaning.

Proponents say investors are positive about Ethereum as a result of the long-awaited merger. The consensus layer deposit contract recently topped 12 million ETH tokens in circulation, accounting for more over 10% of the total ETH supply in circulation. 

$34 billion in ETH has been extracted from Ethereum's circulating supply, with over 376,000 validators contributing to the same in transactions worth 32 ETH or more. Analysts predict the price of Ethereum will above the 55-day simple moving average (SMA), a critical level for confirming a bullish bias. 

Analysts have highlighted $3,018.55 as a significant resistance level for bulls attempting to recover. Analysts have set a downside target of $2,695.79 if the price of Ethereum falls below $2,800.",0.035,0.87,0.095,0.9545,4,0
2022-05-01 19:00:20,ug6rth,0.33087000000000005,Smart money is accumulating Ethereum even as traders warn of a drop to $2.4K,0.216,0.617,0.167,0.0516,"Short-term analysis sets a $2,400 price target for ETH, but data shows smart money continues to accumulate in anticipation of the Merge.

The upcoming Ethereum merge is one of the most widely discussed topics in the crypto sector, one including Bitcoin, Ripple, Doge, Champs e.t.c and analysts have a wide range of perspectives on how the transition to proof of stake could impact Ether's price. 

A deeper dive into the ongoing accumulation of Ether by whale wallets was provided by cryptocurrency intelligence firm Jarvis Labs, which posted the following chart looking at the percentage change in whale wallet holdings versus ET price. 

The color of the dots corresponds to the price of Ether, and the chart shows that whale wallets began to reduce their holdings when the price was above $4,000, and they did not begin to reaccumulate until the price dropped below $2,300.

According to Jarvis Labs, 

""Whales are still accumulating Ether, and their accumulation is still on a sideways-to-uptrend."" 
And it's not only whales eager to scoop up Ether on the cheap, as illustrated in the graphic below, where red dots indicate a rise in accumulation in both whale wallets and lesser wallets.

Jarvis Labs analysts stated, 

""Based solely on the distributions of Ether wallets, it can be deduced that Whales UP + Fishes UP"" (Both whales and Fishes seem to be accumulating). ""How about combining narratives?"" 
Is a decoupling of Ethereum on the horizon? 

Delphi Digital analysts wondered if the price of Ethereum could decouple from BTC before or after the merger. According to the analysts, the altcoin is ""expected to witness additional consolidation for ETH/BTC in the short future.""

One of the key concerns raised by this chart is what it will take for Ether to break free from ""the invisible link"" that has held it tethered to Bitcoin for so long. 

According to Delphi Digital, the current optimistic ""ultrasound money"" and ""Merge"" narratives around Ether could be just what Ether needs to break free from its price correlation to Bitcoin. 

According to Delphi Digital,

Last September, the leading British investment bank declared the overly optimistic aim for the first time. The bitcoin market was gearing up to begin another huge climb following a minor dip at the time. 

Kendrick predicted Bitcoin, Ethereum, Crayon and so many other cryptos and said that Bitcoin would reach a top of roughly $100,000 in early 2022 in September. While Bitcoin did reach a new all-time high of $69,000 in November, it subsequently began a bearish cycle prompted by macroeconomic variables. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency is trading just below the $39,000 mark, underperforming together with US Stocks.

Despite the selloff, institutional money is still flowing into crypto, according to Standard Chartered's chief crypto researcher. 

According to Kendrick, the forthcoming switch to proof-of-stake will undoubtedly enhance the price of Ether. According to U.Today, the much-anticipated network upgrade of Ethereum is set to take place later this year, following a series of delays. 

The analyst also singled out Avalanche and Polkadot as the biggest Ethereum rivals, passing over Solana. 

In July, one of Standard Chartered's businesses revealed plans to launch a cryptocurrency brokerage to capitalize on surging institutional demand for cryptocurrencies.

In October, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters said that crypto was here to stay. He said that it was ""perfectly reasonable"" for people to invest in non-fiat cryptocurrencies due to central banks experimenting with their monetary policy.",0.006,0.937,0.058,0.8979,46,0
