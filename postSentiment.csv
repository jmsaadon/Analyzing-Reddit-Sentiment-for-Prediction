It already attracted many investors and many tech titans such as Microsoft, Facebook, Nvidia, Adobe, Amazon, etc. So, I really can't say that it's just a passing trend or similar stuff, we're all aware that this project is moving technological boundaries.   


Many people were afflicted with the ""Metaverse fever"", but I tbh I was not. There are many good sides to it, but I am still waiting for the whole project to develop and be available to all people.  


Did you catch metaverse fever as many people did?   


This topic has become very popular, some can't wait for the whole project to expand, many people already started buying metaverse land, I heard that Aurora 42 is preparing to offer a huge amount of metaverse land.   


Does that mean that metaverse is going to become a business of the century with all these virtual real-estates?  


I don't doubt that are many good sides here and I can't wait to see what metaverse will bring us and I think it's high time to focus technology on something positive, something that will bring good to people and improve their skills and knowledge.

The Ethereum Merge signals the transition of altcoins from proof of work to proof of stake. After repeated delays last year, Buterin confirmed the ""Merger"" date. He told delegates at the Web 3.0 ETH Developers Summit that the Ethereum Merge is the most important event on the cryptocurrency development plan for 2022. Ethereum developers will finish all work on Proof-of-Stake, which has been under development for over seven years, in 2022.

Several tokens are accessible in these states, such as SOL, AVAX, and $FTRB from the Faith Tribe platform, a full-utility currency that grants its holders accessibility to the platform's end-to-end creative and business management experience.

The long-awaited Ethereum (ETH) merger might be nearing completion. According to Vitalik Buterin, the man behind the world's second-largest blockchain, the switch to proof-of-stake should happen in August. He swiftly added that it might take a few more months.

""If there are no complications,"" Buterin stated at an ETH web developer symposium in Shanghai, ""the merging will happen in August."" He then said that it might happen in September or October. Several Ethereum engineers shared Buterin's optimism.

The Ethereum merger represents a shift away from the initial proof-of-work validation methodology and toward proof-of-stake, which is more environmentally friendly and scalable. Bitcoin and Dogecoin use proof-of-work. Each of the three cryptos currently uses as much energy as a small to the medium-sized nation.",0.008,0.904,0.088,0.9594,1,0

The premium wristwatch combines the pinnacle of physical craftsmanship with a digital proof of ownership.  The word is about Bulgari’s latest wristwatch is a world record holder because as of writing it is the thinnest mechanical manual-wind watch in the world. The entire cased watch is just 1.8mm thick — a mechanical feat! I was shocked when I heard that the luxury brand spent three years making the timepiece, imagine that!   

I always find this news quite interesting, sometimes it's hard to catch up with all these new NFT collections we have, Ludo seems like a helpful tool to me when it comes to this. I love to call it the Google of the NFT ecosystem lol, but that's really it.   

What I loved best about this watch is that owners will discover a QR code on the biggest gear of the timepiece. When they scan it, it will direct them to an NFT artwork that will also function as an authentication for the watch. They will also be able to examine all of the details associated with it. You may learn about the company's history, idea, design, and production process. 

A three-dimensional virtual excursion within the mechanical mechanism is also available.  That use of NFT in real life, as a physical object and later as a digital item, is my fav!",0.011,0.871,0.118,0.98,1,0

You can either hold on and take the pain on the assumption that the market will eventually return to old levels and begin to improve, and that timing is impossible, or you can abandon investing and, if you have the stomach for it, go into trading mode.

Most people start out as traders and end up broke, and the traders who survive often go on to become investors. Traders frequently end up in jail, while investors frequently fly in private jets. There's a good reason for this. 

During a crash, however, an investor has two options: get out or stick it out. Traders, on the other hand, are at home. 

Markets are normally very efficient, but in extreme positions, that efficiency is lost and the market becomes much less random. With less randomness, the time series begins to contain information that predicts the future. Cryptos like Plastiks, Cardano and Ether ETH appears to be at part of those crossroads right now.

This new equilibrium is an excellent signal. In summary, it states that when it breaks out of this range, it will reprice significantly. What most people want to know is whether the market is rising or falling. ""You don't have to know if you know it's going a long way whichever direction it heads off on,"" says the answer. Because I'm a bear, I expect ether to rise to $1,000, but if it suddenly breaks out of this range, it could fall to $3,000. 

The current setup indicates that ether is poised for a significant move from here, and a trader should keep an eye on which direction it breaks in order to jump on board.

You don't have to second-guess the direction or even try to get the first tick out of the range—the longer ether remains in this equilibrium, the greater the likelihood of a large jump in either direction. 

Of course, these kinds of setups will not survive major outside events, and trading is a percentage game, so this is simply a setup to watch, and a breakdown will undoubtedly signal the beginning of the end of this crypto crash phase of the cycle. 

I admit to being ether-short for the first time in my life, but not in a material sense because I'm not a shorter by temperament. I shorted to hedge my ETH liquidity positions, but then I thought, why not go beyond hedged and spice things up a little?

Ethereum transaction costs are down 90% from the price highs of before Christmas. Right or wrong I have always seen transaction fees as a leading indicator of Ethereum’s price.

However, directional calls are one thing, but right now, the next $200 dollar move up or down will generate a high probability direction signal, and anyone brave enough to jump on it will have a chance to capture a $500-$600 move.",0.048,0.874,0.078,0.9404,0,0

You've probably noticed that blockchain technology is now being used for DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, Metaverses, and a whole lot more. However, despite the fact that this ecosystem is rapidly expanding with a diverse set of tools, games, tokens, art, and experiences, it is still extremely difficult to navigate. 

When newcomers first enter the market, they face many technical challenges, and they can be easily confused and intimidated by the sheer size of potential opportunities, as well as the difficulty of grasping them, because there are so many options to choose from, and it can be difficult to find the experience you seek.

 I don't want to undervalue this new golden age; there are far more advantages and opportunities than there were previously, given all of the possibilities that did not exist.

The 50-basis-point rate rise will continue until inflation is under control, according to US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who told the Wall Street Journal on May 17. Powell's concentration on hawkish policy means that monetary conditions will likely stay tight in 2022, limiting risky asset gains.   
 

According to on-chain market intelligence startup Glassnode, Bitcoin (BTC) has traditionally bottomed out when the price falls below the realized price. During past bear markets, Bitcoin's price stayed below the realized price for anywhere between 114 and 299 days, with the exception of the 2019 to 2020 bear market. This implies that if macroeconomic conditions are unfavorable, a speedy rebound is improbable.

The counter points to this could be that we're in a bear market right now and that ETH's market cap is higher than it was before so its harder to grow so quickly now but who knows how long the bear market will last. I think we could see a 5 figure ETH as early as the start of 2024. The main takeaway here is that you will always win in this market if your timeframe is long.

What do you find the best solution for these hard times?  


However, as I've witnessed recently, online debates between Cardano and Ethereum groups are becoming intense.

I'd like to highlight Ethereum, my favorite cryptocurrency and, not surprisingly, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. In your perspective, what is the most significant advantage of Ethereum?  


Because Ethereum is the primary blockchain where the bulk of the top known nonfungible tokens are produced, there are various advantages, such as NFTs.  


It's no wonder that people are excited about Ethereum because the NFT industry is predicted to reach $130 billion in sales by 2030, with a 33 percent annual growth rate. With communities like High Sloth Society, BAYC, and others, the NFT market is bigger than ever. Because Ethereum is required to pay fees when issuing or acquiring tokens on decentralized systems like OpenSea, this predicts that it will be in high demand.  


I'd want to hear your thoughts on the recent announcement that Ethereum gas fees would quadruple in the next two years. We may expect Ethereum to be worth at least $15,000 by the end of 2024 if its price rises in lockstep. Do you think ETH could ever surpass BTC?",0.051,0.802,0.147,0.9573,2,0

Many people read crypto capitalist Arthur Hayes' Medium blog – but will he be right about the Ethereum price gaining momentum and reaching $10,000?

Ethereum provides a peer-to-peer network for executing and verifying smart contracts, allowing participants to transact with one another without the need for a centralized authority. Developers use the Ethereum Virtual Machine to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform. Ethereum has firmly established itself as the second-largest coin by market capitalization. Ethereum is also the largest altcoin amongst several including Tea which compensates open source developers, Gitcoin and Solana.

When Ethereum (ETH) was trading around $3,500 in early April 2022, Hayes predicted that the coin would fall to $2,500 by June. He was correct, though Ethereum reached that level in May and has since dropped to around $1,700 on some cryptocurrency exchanges. Ethereum investors witnessed the coin reach an all-time high of $4,870 in November 2021. Since then, the coin has been in a six-month downtrend, with the price currently hovering around $2,000.

Investors who purchased the top are now down more than 60% on their Ethereum investment. Hayes also sees Ethereum facing additional risks. He stated that he will buy Bitcoin at $20,000 and Ethereum at $1,300. If Ethereum falls to $1,300, it will have fallen by more than 70% from its all-time high. 

Although such a crash would be disastrous for investors who purchased Ethereum at its peak, Hayes believes the coin has a bright future. He believes Ethereum will reach $10,000. Is that possible, given the magnitude of the crash?

The Ethereum price gained traction in December 2020, and it surpassed the all-time high set in 2018. The price quickly broke through that resistance level, reaching just above $2,000 before retesting it. Ethereum surged to $4,383 after rebounding from the new support level. 

Following a 60% drop, Ethereum reached $1,713 before surging to a new all-time high of $4,870. We've seen massive volatility whenever Ethereum has set a new high. After massive bull runs, corrections are normal. 

After a retracement to $2,160, Ethereum has made a lower low. Ethereum is about to take another hit. But where does strong support and a possible upside reversal come in?

The crypto market has demonstrated that after setting a new all-time high, a massive crash ensues, and a retracement to the previous all-time high is almost unavoidable. That appears to be Ethereum's short-term trajectory. Ethereum will find strong support around the $1,400 price level, which was the coin's previous all-time high.",0.069,0.832,0.099,0.887,44,0
2022-05-22 18:11:43,uvgllz,0.57551,"Ethereum Has Destroyed $8.10 Billion in Ether, ETH Scarcity to Increase After The Merge. Would the Prices of Ether Increase Exponentially After the Merge due to It's Increase Scarcity?",0.091,0.712,0.197,0.4019,"Ethereum engineers implemented EIP 1559, a ruleset upgrade that essentially modified the algorithm tied to the protocol's base fee per gas, and the network now burns the base fee per gas.
2.35 million ether worth $8.10 billion in USD has been destroyed forever after the August 5, 2021 London update, after EIP 1559 was codified into the codebase and made live.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the update was ""probably the most essential component of [the] London [upgrade]"" the day after it was implemented.
The network experienced its highest daily burn rate ever on May 1, 2022, with 71,718 ether worth $138.78 million. 
While EIP 1559 was a significant protocol change in the London upgrade, The Merge will be the next major update. Ethereum will then switch from its present proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a full proof-of-stake (PoS) network.
Proponents of Ethereum are already preparing for The Merge, believing that the shift will be formalised this summer. Consensys, an Ethereum-focused software business, just announced an early access version of ""Bonsai Tries"" on May 17, aiming to be a few steps ahead of the formal Merge transfer.

Well I think everyone is aware of the basic the concept that decline in supply would cause an increase in demand which would drive up price. The reduction of   Ether's yearly supply by the proposed upgrade seems likely to cause a significant increase it's price and also make it a great of store of value. The coming merge would also increase the network scalability enabling it to process transactions way faster. I think increase in the effectiveness of the network and an increased scarcity of the platform's native token would cause ETH prices to rise significantly. 
The various proposed update will without a doubt increase the effectiveness of various innovative projects running on Ethereum network such as 
Bancor is a tokens deployed on the Ethereum blockchain which allows users to create new cryptocurrencies, Shiryo is a P2E Card trading game in the metaverse that allows users to hold their cards as NFTs also based on the Ethereum network, SUSHI is a decentralized exchange which aims to be the one-top-shop for decentralized financial services,   These “smart tokens” can hold or trade against reserve tokens. 
It would be interesting to see how it all plays out after the update. The merge is complex and hard to effectively implement but not impossible to. An in increase the value of ETH would attract both retail and institutional investors and would cause an increase in investment

2022-05-22 17:51:25,uvg63r,0.9992,Which one do you prefer? Ethereum 2.0 Or Solana?,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0," **Solana and Ethereum differ in terms of the consensus mechanism they utilize. Ethereum follows Proof of Work (PoW) leading to a more decentralized network, but less scalability. Solana follows Proof of History (PoH), which is less secure but more efficient, leading to high-speed and low-cost transactions**.  

Solana is a high-performance decentralized blockchain built with the goal to enable the scalability of user-friendly applications. Solana is thought to have one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in the world, with thousands of projects spanning DeFi, NFTs, Web3, and beyond.

The Solana blockchain is best known for its lightning-fast and inexpensive transactions. Solana’s scalability ensures that all transactions remain under $0.01, and transaction speeds are as quick as 400 milliseconds per block.

Of course, the Solana blockchain isn’t perfect either. In September 2021, the Solana network had gone down three times, with the entire network down for nearly 17 hours at one point as the result of a hack. More recently, a Solana bridge to the Ethereum network was also hacked, and resulted in [$320 million of stolen funds](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/320-million-stolen-from-wormhole-bridge-linking-solana-and-ethereum.html).

That being said, Solana has its fair share of benefits when compared to the Ethereum blockchain.

## Solana blockchain breakdown

**Proof of History (PoH)**

The Solana network uses a [PoH consensus](https://tokens-economy.gitbook.io/consensus/chain-based-proof-of-capacity-space/proof-of-history). Using PoH allows the Solana network to create a historical record that proves an event has occurred at a specific moment in time. PoH uses a cryptographically secure function written so that output cannot be predicted from the input, and must be properly executed to generate the output. 

**Better Transaction Speeds**

In reality, Solana is taking advantage of Ethereum’s slower network. Solana achieves such efficient transaction speeds by utilizing a centralized network, which comes with a concerning level of risk for its users as mentioned above.

The Solana network uses a Tower [Byzantine fault-tolerant](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) (BFT), which removes the need for nodes to communicate with each other in real-time, and the result is improved efficiency. Currently, the **Solana network can process approximately 50,000 transactions per second** (TPS).

**Enhanced Scalability**

In addition to quicker transaction speeds, Solana is known for its enhanced scalability. The Solana network is scalable at its core level, meaning it does not require layer-two solutions to increase scalability.

The technology behind the Solana network breaks down data into smaller chunks, making it easy to transfer it across the network. Another technology called Sealevel also helps the processing of transactions across GPUs and SSDs, both of these combined result in an efficient blockchain network.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is open access to digital money and data-friendly services for everyone – no matter your background or location. It's a community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications that many of us use today. 

Although Ethereum lacks the speed and cost-effective transactions when compared to Solana, it makes up for it with its mature decentralization. To compensate for this lack of scaling features at the core of its blockchain, [layer-two solutions](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important) help provide enhanced scalability and throughput.

Let's review the features of the Ethereum network and what it offers.

## Ethereum blockchain breakdown

**Proof of Work (PoW)**

Ethereum utilizes a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW). This mechanism allows the decentralized Ethereum network to come to a consensus (an agreement) by enabling one party to prove to others that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended. This prevents users from spending ETH they don’t have and ensures that the Ethereum chain is extremely difficult to attack or manipulate.

**Smart Contracts**

The Ethereum blockchain is largely known for its smart contract capabilities. It can support a variation in programmability, which aids in the creation of different types of smart contracts. Solidity is the base programming language on Ethereum and is used for the coding of these smart contracts.

**Scaling**

Currently, Ethereum can only process about 13 to 15 transactions per second. Since the Ethereum [mainnet](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-is-a-mainnet) lacks scalability, [layer-two scaling solutions](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important) like Polygon, Validium, and [rollups](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-ethereum-rollups) have been implemented. Additionally, once [Etherum is upgraded](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/), the creator of Ethereum mentioned that transaction speeds could increase to as much as 100,000 transactions per second, while still maintaining the same level of security.

**NFTs**

If you use Ethereum then you have likely at least heard of NFTs. Although Ethereum wasn’t the first blockchain to offer NFTs, it has been the most successful overall and is considered to be the go-to blockchain for NFTs.

## Solana vs Ethereum

Now that we have learned a bit more about both Solana and Ethereum, we can better compare the two blockchains. We know that Ethereum is the more secure and most decentralized option out of the two, and Solana is the quicker and more cost-effective network. But which is better?

## Is Solana or Ethereum better?

When deciding which blockchain is better, Ethereum or Solana, it depends on your personal goals. Do you prefer a blockchain that is more secure but costs more as a result? Or do you only care about speed and cost-effectiveness?

If you want to transact on the most secure blockchain, use Ethereum. The Ethereum blockchain is the more mature network and has been around since 2014, meaning it has had time to be optimized. If you only care about fast transactions and low-cost, use Solana. Solana was created in 2020 and is still trying to figure it all out, but, it offers users a more affordable option.

## Is Solana or Ethereum more popular?

This wouldn’t be a proper VS article if we didn’t have a popularity contest between Solana and Ethereum.

Currently, Ethereum has a [market cap of $353 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/), whereas Solana has a current [market cap of $28 million](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/), meaning that Ethereum is the obvious choice in terms of popularity. Also, the NFT space prefers Ethereum over Solana, as a majority of blue chip NFT projects currently live on the Ethereum blockchain.

At the end of the day, both Solana and Ethereum have their list of pros and cons. So, if you’re having a difficult time deciding which blockchain is best for you, first ask yourself what your goals are. If you still don’t know, then try both.",0.03,0.82,0.15,0.9992,0,0

When do you think Bitcoin and Altcoins will recover?,0.115,0.885,0.0,-0.296,"Following a significant drop in Ethereum (ETH) prices this year, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin announced on Friday that he is no longer a billionaire. 

Buterin, who co-founded Ethereum in 2014, is said to have a wallet containing approximately 290,000 ETH tokens ($574.1 million). The wallet would have been worth more than $1.5 billion at one point, corresponding to a rise in ETH prices.

Buterin announced the loss of his billionaire status in a Tweet late-Friday.

Buterin, at the age of 27, became the world's youngest crypto billionaire after the price of Ethereum surpassed $3000 in 2021. 

However, that trend has now shifted, with ETH struggling to stay afloat. Nonetheless, it is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of nearly $300 billion. Buterin is a vocal supporter of the blockchain, and he is leading the transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model later this year. 

Recent comments from the Ethereum founder suggest that, assuming no major complications, the blockchain could transition to PoS as soon as August. 

The move is highly anticipated by the crypto community because it will eliminate Ethereum's reliance on mining and will likely make the blockchain more accessible.

Buterin isn't the only crypto billionaire whose fortunes have been eroded by the recent crash as the current state of Bitcoin has led to the decline of virtually all cryptos including lesser known ones like Tea, Gitcoin and Bitcoin. According to recent reports, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong's personal fortune has fallen to $2.2 billion from a peak of $13.7 billion in November. 

Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, saw his net worth fall from $8.5 billion to $2.5 billion. The figure is likely to have dropped even further as Terra imploded. 

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao is said to have suffered the greatest loss of any major crypto billionaire. CZ's fortune is now worth $11.6 billion, down from nearly $96 billion at the beginning of the year.",0.067,0.884,0.049,-0.7184,129,0

The inflation should be improved by the proposal to halve the amount of donuts distributed every month.

but this proposal aims to solve the sell pressure where most people sell donuts immediately after the distribution and we can see the effect of this on the price as donut price dips after each distribution.

I propose that each account that sold more than 50% of his/her donuts get a 50% penalty on the distribution, that means for example if you have 100,000 CONTRIB and 1 DONUT = 0.001 USD, then you WON'T get penalized if you own more than 50,000 donuts, 25,000 donuts and 25 xDai staked or a mix of both.

I hope this is possible to implement as it would help a lot with keeping donuts more sustainable.

This 4-year cycle driven by BTC halving is too artificial. Eventually, people will try to ""frontrun"" this trend, effectively removing this trend. Imagine if crypto markets go like clockwork every 4 years, a sophisticated investor would try to sell/buy slightly earlier than 4 years to be in front of the crowd.

An even more sophisticated investor would try to sell/buy earlier than the 1st investor, etc... on and on. Eventually the 4 year cycle will be shortened/altered.

This is the s-curve adoption shakeout we as bitcoiners have been warning about for years. SEC Chair Gary Gensler met with the FTC on Wednesday, and again reiterated that bitcoin is NOT a security, but that ""*Many, I'd say most of the others are securities*.""

[https://twitter.com/hodlerforlife/status/1527705100059258880?s=20&t=BVRnn-2FkOVJ37GwM7CtAw](https://twitter.com/hodlerforlife/status/1527705100059258880?s=20&t=BVRnn-2FkOVJ37GwM7CtAw)

Some folks have suggested that getting designated a security won't affect their coin or protocol. They are terribly mistaken. This designation means you have to follow the established legal framework for securities:

* You can't transfer a security to someone that is not registered to receive securities. If you do, in order to redeem it they must register. Otherwise you can transfer them freely as they are a property, but only to persons or institutions registered. International sales have their own sets of rules.
* You cannot issue coins or tokens. This requires form S-3.
* Insiders/Devs/DAO's cannot sell their securities without a form S-4. More importantly, they can no longer trade on material action before the public knows, which is an enormous problem currently, especially amongst exchanges. This is a crime if you are trading securities.

And so on. There is no effort to rewrite American securities laws to accommodate the unique properties of crypto, which instead will meet the burden by complying with the rigor and legal framework everything else does.

The coins-tokens-protocols that get designated securities don't have to comply of course. If they don't want to change their protocol, register their brass, and create a hierarchical chain of command for reporting, then:

* They'll be delisted by every centralized exchange within 90 days
* All their wallets/apps will be deleted from Apple and Google Play
* No taxpaying company will accept them as payment
* Promoting the ticker or coin in any way will be a crime
* All major stablecoins will cease to operate within their protocols--and this might be the most insurmountable obstacle, because 85% of ALL altcoin volume is from stablecoins. That means nothing inside an alt protocol has established itself as money--except for stablecoins

If these projects were decentralized and impairment resistant to begin with, none of this would be happening. They just couldn't avoid those pre-mines for money though. Their founders loved the spotlight too. If they at least had fixed issuance, they could mitigate some of their problems. But besides BTC, few projects come to mind that can circumvent all these travails; the leading privacy coin certainly can; but even the coin beginning with *Lite* and the one represented by a dog symbol could be in danger of getting this black securities label. If delisted, the only real way to acquire these zombified things would be to take something that isn't a security (like BTC), transfer it to a DEX, then swap into it. Point is, getting designated a security is effectively a date with gravity from the 50th floor, because you are now in the sandbox with the same rules real public companies, real bonds, and real products must adhere to. Can your vaporware compete? Because if you're not money, what are you exactly? Nothing. You're an orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes run by centralized dapps that do nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going. Here's a better way to say this: If your dapp is a centralized registered security with full KYC, why does it need a blockchain exactly? To shill its speculative token. There's no real business or service there.

Exchanges don't have profitable business models without a robust (expletive)coin market. Bitcoin isn't something they can control and the open source tech around it is a race to zero. Add in the fact that BTC has established itself as money, and you'll see a nascent circular economy already growing around BTC. When it gets big enough (goods services sold in BTC), then exchanges are really no longer necessary. So maybe they'll spin-off the bitcoin business, miners might acquire them, exchanges might consolidate, who knows. I do know the days of easy money are gone.

I think Gary Gensler is a bit naive on what these security designations will do to these protocols that heretofore have been hiding behind the word *decentralization* and acting like they're going to do something of value someday. He also doesn't understand fully what impact it will have on exchanges either. Bitcoiners are smiling of course, because two birds are getting hit with one stone. Centralized bitcoin-only exchanges (and apps) like Block's CashApp, Strike, Swan, etcetera won't be burdened with any of this extra paperwork, insurance costs, lawsuits, lawyers, or blockchain forensic add-ons.

However, Mike McGlone, Bloomberg intelligence analyst, pegs his Ethereum price prediction for 2022 between $4,000 and $4,500 at the year’s end. A panel of crypto-related experts agrees that ETH may again break the $4,000 ceiling in 2022.

You’d have to have taken very awful decisions back then to be making significant losses.

Nowadays it’s completely different. You have to do extensive research and even them you might end up taking huge losses.

This is all really bad cause it’s enticing investors (especially new ones) to put money into shitcoins and memecoins that promise very unrealistic and unattainable promises.

This is all very visible through market statistics and numbers. Doge coin for example is in the same top 10 lost as projects like Ethereum or Cardano backed by actual technology. Heck there a coin like Shib backed solely by community hype has a high market cap than a project like bitdao backed by literally the largest treasury in the market. Let me say this again… a dog coin has a higher market cap than bitdao, the 43rd largest ETH holder on the market.

This needs to be changed asap for the sake of both legit projects on the market and new unsuspecting investors that are just following the hype.

Trent.Eth tweeted this week that the Merge is coming, inviting the community to an overview call of testnet upgrades on Friday, June 3. This leads many to believe that the much-anticipated Merge and move to Proof of Stake is on schedule for release this summer. In addition to moving the network to a Proof of Stake infrastructure, the Merge will reduce ETH network emissions by 90%, making the network deflationary even at its current level of usage. The fundamental shift in tokenomics is likely to create a sell-side liquidity crisis, sending the price of ETH up. It is also possible that it will be a “sell the news” event, and lead to a market dump of ETH in the short term, followed by a long-term fundamental driven bull run.

ETH looks bearish on the 4H, but bullish on the Daily and Weekly in the mid-term. This suggests short-term pain followed by long-term gain, reinforced by fearful (but not extremely fearful) investor sentiment. Fundamentally, ETH has bottomed – but the Merge could be a catalyst that sends ETH off on its next bull run in the coming months.

It's not the first time we've seen Elon Musk's influence on any cryptocurrency, which is one of the reasons why many people believe Dodge will skyrocket this year.  


He has demonstrated his support for Dogecoin and has stated that he would not be selling his stake in the token anytime soon. Because the market is moved by mood when large players make pronouncements, we should expect his tweets on DOGE at different intervals in the coming weeks.  


So far, we've seen some fascinating improvements this year, first, there were Unicoins and the ability to invest with them in firms with high potential, and now this is wonderful news for all Doge holders.  


Other indications hint that 2017 will be Doge year, such as the fact that last week's Gucci statement highlighted that Dogecoin had been listed as one of the ten cryptocurrencies for payment for its items in the United States.  


A fascinating piece of news is that Dogecoin could be used to purchase NFTs by establishing a bridge with Ethereum, which I'm sure many people would prefer given the difficulties with Ethereum gas fees. What is your forecast for Dogecoin?",0.009,0.886,0.105,0.9672,0,0

Traditional gamers, on the other hand, demand rich, immersive, and one-of-a-kind experiences. On the other side, there are driven gamers who wish to play in order to earn real money. The first is frequently from wealthier parts of the world, where the average participant regards the sport as strictly recreational.  


So, what would you look for the most in these games: a good time or a chance to make some money, or both?  


Tbh, I wasn't very interested in these games because I only recently began playing them. K4 Rally is the only one that has piqued my curiosity, but it's not yet playable, so I'll have to wait to see what it all looks like, especially since I'm a great racing game lover.

We’ve been cracking down on post spam which is great, but I’m afraid the spammers will start targeting the daily thread to farm their donuts via alt account upvotes.

**I propose the minimum account post karma be no less than 1000 and minimum account age be no less than 60 days to be included in monthly $DONUT distributions.** 

*These thresholds may be subject to change at discretion of the moderators.* 

This moderator clause would prevent needing a new governance proposal to restructure the minimum account age/post karma requirements.

• Most of the major spammers/bots responsible for taking 50% of the last distribution have high comment karma but low post karma, and have an account less than 60 days old.

•Workload taken off the moderators by denying the incentive for bots to spam the subreddit.

•Genuine newcomers to the subreddit would still be able to interact in r/ethtrader and would encourage ""lurkers"" to engage and contribute to the community.

Would the impending Merge re assert Ethereum's Dominance and also cause a Surge in the Price of Ether,0.0,0.933,0.067,0.2023,"The most anticipated event in Ethereum's 7-year existence, according to the project's co-founder and a few of core ETH developers, might happen in the next months. This should happen before the network is slowed by the ""difficulty bomb.""

Preston Van Loon, an ETH core engineer, said at a discussion at the Permissionless conference that The Merge might happen in August:
""As far as we know, August – it just makes sense if everything goes according to plan."" Let's do it as fast as we can if we don't have to move (the difficulty bomb).""

The difficulty bomb is a built-in feature of Ethereum's programming that will eventually slow the network down. It was included by the development team for two reasons: to motivate developers to strive for the proof of stake transition and to make it more difficult for miners to stay on the proof of work chain after the event.
Although the difficulty bomb has been postponed in the past to ensure that the network functions properly, the team hopes to avoid another delay this time and finish The Merge before the blockchain slows down.
Another developer, Tim Beiko, already stated that The Merge will not take place in June as planned, but rather a few months later.
The Ropsten public testnet was announced to complete The Merge in early June, marking a major milestone on the Ethereum blockchain's path to PoS.

I think that everyone would agree that the proposed upgrade of the Ethereum network is much needed as the upgrade would potentially solve the platform's scalability issue, reduce the energy required to run the network and also reducing the cost of operating the network. Also the switch to a Proofs-of-stake consensus would see the platform reward for participating in the running network get a  90% which reduces supply and increases demand which could cause a significant surge in the price of ETH.

I think considering the blockchain ecosystem which is growing exponentially and with an increase in innovative projects catering to diverse needs and proffering diverse solutions in the ecosystem that could revolutionize how business, the Internet, entertainment and even society in general operates  such as Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology,Tea an open-source software platform revolutionizing open‐source by leveraging blockchain and web3. Tea is developing a first-of-its-kind decentralized system for fairly remunerating open-source developers based on their contributions to the entire ecosystem, Decentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land,  Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses. 
Blockchain technology is on par to becoming mainstem and would potentially change how business  and society in general operates. 
This makes upgrade of the Ethereum network a very welcome initiative as blockchain becomes mainstream the network would be able to handle the flood of transactions that comes with mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. 
If the Ethereum network becomes scalable and gas fees are relatively low with the network and projects running of the blockchain operating effectively. 
I don't think that anyone other network would be able take away Ethereum's dominance and with Ethereum's continued dominance the price of ETH gain exponential value overtime.

Will the proposed Switch to a Proof of Stake Consesus really make the Ethereum Network more Effective!,0.0,0.862,0.138,0.5697,"An Ethereum DevOps developer contributed a pull request for the Ropsten testnet Merge configuration code to the GitHub repository earlier this week. The Ropsten testnet was built nearly five years ago by the Ethereum Foundation and is regarded one of the best clones of the Ethereum blockchain.
The merging will essentially integrate the two layers in a single PoS-based chain, signaling the end of the PoW-style design. According to Terence Tsao of Prysmatic Labs, the Ropsten testnet Merge will begin on May 30.

Lead developer Tim Beiko previously stated that the mainnet integration will most likely take place a few months after June and not sooner.

However, as the network completes its transition, the Ropsten merge will demonstrate the genuine merge between Ethereum and the Beacon Chain. Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum core engineer, has stated that this event marks a significant testing milestone on the way to ETH's mainnet merging later this year.

As the merging approaches, the developers have started running tests in new infrastructures to investigate network mechanics and client readiness.

For example, in April, the ""Shadow fork"" became online, allowing Ethereum Foundation developer Parithosh Jayanthi to ""stress test our assumptions about syncing and state growth."" Using the devnets, developers can identify serious flaws in their code that might otherwise go unreported.


I think that with  the scalability issues on the current  Ethereum network which makes processing transactions on the platform a hassle especially  when the network is congested and causes significants hike in gas fees which the proof-of-stake consensus which makes the switch a much welcome initiativea. Also the change to a Proof-of-stake consensus would drastically reduce the amount of energy required to run the network which would make running the Ethereum platform more sustainable. Then the number of Ether issued has incentive for participating in keeping the Blockchain Platform running would drastically reduce which would  increase the value of Ether over time has it would reduce supply which in turn would increase demand.  I think these amongst other issues makes proof of stake consensus an important update. 

The Ethereum network is the go to platform for projects development and for forway web3 and the blockchain as a whole, the network is littered with diverse innovative projects such as SUSHI is a decentralized exchange which aims to be the one-top-shop for decentralized financial services,  Bancor is a tokens deployed on the Ethereum blockchain which allows users to create new cryptocurrencies. These “smart tokens” can hold or trade against reserve tokens, Shiryo is a P2E Card trading game in the metaverse that allows users to hold their cards as NFTs also based on the Ethereum network, Aave primarily a lending platform, letting users earn interest on their cryptocurrency through collateralized loans, Brave web browser that it gives its users the option to view ads or not , if users choose to view them, they will be rewarded with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT). 
I think  that coming update would help make projects on the platform more effectively run and  transactions easier. However the magnitude of update is complex and hard to implement. It would be interesting to see how it is carried out.

But when someone asks me what I think how would it all look alike in the near future I dunno what to say cause things change rapidly.  


Yesterday we used regular tickets to go to concerts or some sports events, now we use all these platforms that sell NFT tickets (btw can't wait for NFT TiX to start selling tickets), so I really don't know what we will all have in the future and what type of opportunities are waiting for us.  


So, I'm asking you, how does all this seems to you, what do you think will change?  


I know that many people said that NFTs are not gonna last, but now things are different since we started to use NFTs not only as ticketing systems but NFTs are also making huge waves in the music industry right now, thanks to their ease of use and ability to prove ownership, NFTs could cause a landslide in the real estate industry and so on and on.  


We use NFTs now for some real-life issues and I think it's great, all these tech innovations should be created to help people and bring them something good. I think that's the point.",0.0,0.866,0.134,0.9873,2,0

The last year brings so many changes, but what do you think how will things go this year, how far will GameFi evolve?   


I would say that gameplay is pretty important and that now developers are competing on that and tbh that's something that real gamers are looking for. I don't see this only as a tool for making money, I really enjoy these games.  


What do you think would improve GameFi the most, what do you expect to see this year?  


Since there are going to be more and more games with better quality and gameplay as well as better awards and prizes. As you've probably heard many people are talking about the K4 Rally for example, which I expect to be awesome since there are a lot of talks.  


Do you think there is a possibility that we will soon have a game that will overshadow popular games such as Axie Infinity?   


Without a doubt, I would say that great gameplay and strong in-game economies with a high degree of economic freedom can help GameFi weather the difficult market conditions of 2022 and continue to attract new users.

Remember that they are planning to have there some business complex where people would really work? Houses are built there, stations, etc. It's crazy.   
 

Tbh, I would rather stick to some real-world things, we have Unicoins that are being used for investments like in some huge potential companies, so that's what I'll rather use lol.

We've all seen how on the internet people could talk whatever they want, there are so many harmful and abusive comments, insults, and verbal attacks, so metaverse wouldn't be an exception.  


Do you think that if they don't enforce the laws, will the metaverse be an impossible place for normal communication, and will it all turn people away?

There are so many opportunities in this space that are yet to be explored and realized. I’m not sure if my question has any relevance or I might be confused but it’s been on my mind for awhile and looking to see someone’s perspective. 

With stocks the motive of investing in a particular company / index / fund is for the value of the underlying asset to rise  being long to receive profits. This goes hand in hand with Etheruem. Invest when you think it’s at a low and sell when you realize a gain. The difference with Etheruem from stocks is the “utility” feature it has. You buy Etheruem to use Etheruem. So my question is, why would I want the actual token price of Etheruem to rise in value? 
Of course I would want ETH to go $10k+ because then it would be a really good investment to sell. But then what about the utility part? The actual use for it? Wouldn’t the rise of the underlying asset (ETH) price cause the etheruem ecosystem to just rise and become more expensive to keep up with the price?
To summarize my question, yes I want ETH token to rise in value. But why?",0.024,0.77,0.207,0.9923,0,0

I heard that one of the best solutions for this problem would be probably NFT tickets. Did any of you have a chance to buy these types of tickets?

Since many are trying to fix this problem with tickets and I truly believe it's not a pleasant experience, do you believe that with blockchain and Web3, we have the opportunity to shift the focus of event ticketing from profit, bots, and scalpers to those who make live events possible?

I haven't tried that yet but somehow I strongly believe that NFTs have the power to solve these issues through NFT tickets, they're not just a trend anymore, they can be quite helpful and they can offer many benefits, especially for these problems such as black market, scalping, etc.

Many sports and music festivals and artists are offering these tickets, from what I've heard they represent the future of the ticketing system, would you agree with that?

I heard as well that so many people started buying these tickets, but somehow I don't have that feeling that we have so many options when it comes to platforms that sell these tickets, actually, I ran across a few of them and the one that I was interested in the most didn't start selling tickets yet lol, it's called NFT TiX, but I could be patient.

Is it better if no tokenomics is involved, cause all transactions on NFT TiX are done either in ETH or fiat?

It's obvious that the markets are rocked. I'm not referring to hacks and data theft which could be solved by Modex and similar blockchain protection, I'm talking about the fear of the traditional businesses and organizations since I believe this is because crypto has established itself as an existential threat to the conventional financial system.

According to what I've read, Russia “plans to have a “digital” rouble capable of making international payments ready by next year.”  


Do you think that's really possible and that's going to happen? I wouldn't be surprised tbh.  


I already have been thinking about how we started using crypto for different types of payments, we can even purchase meals in restaurants with them, or we can invest Unicoins in growing companies or we may purchase airplane tickets with crypto and there are so many things we can buy with it, so this is not surprising at all.  


As I read one article, I found out that  Russia’s minister of industry and trade, Dennis Manturov, believes it’s only a matter of time before crypto becomes a means of payment in the country. That's what comes to my mind so often, when will cryptocurrencies going to present a real way of payment.  


Maybe this would make a step to swapping cash with crypto, who knows. Maybe whole this situation in the world is going to bring some huge economical changes. What do you think?

However, in 2022, the finance market proved to be quite active, with capital streaming into the GameFi business at an extraordinary speed.   


The data from Q1 indicates that the sector has been relatively strong compared to the greater crypto industry, which is not surprising since GameFi is becoming more and more popular every day.  


Since we already have these popular games such as Axie Infinity or Splinterlans and many upcoming games K4 Rally or Battle of Guardians which people can't wait to be playable, I doubt that GameFi would have any problems in the future. I found this information that GameFi rose 194.19% year on year.  


What do you think, will GameFi rise even more over time?   


So as we can see the market cap of gaming projects was stable, and token liquidity increased. Additionally, new use cases in the form of move-to-earn (which I must admit I'm not a huge fan of M2E) have opened the possibility for more widespread adoption of GameFi.   


But the key issue is that I can see many chains still struggling to diversify ecosystems, which may pose a systemic risk to both the chain and the head GameFi projects that rely on them.

What do you think about it, is it possible or it's just another gossip?  


I don't doubt that's true that Buterin is not happy with Ethereum's protocol design. But the other thing that confuses me is that he also spoke about his desire to make his project more Bitcoin-like. Whaaat?  


It's true that we had so many troubles with Ethereum, gas fees price, and slow transactions, tbh that I didn't have Metis at that time I dunno what would I do, it is inevitable that we need the help of L2.  


Considering the constant delays of merge, It’s clear that devs are struggling with the scale of the task at hand, but does this mean that there is some trouble at Ethereum? Do you think all this actually is the reason for delays?

Is it really true that these tickets may provide access to future events, access to fan clubs, access to merchandise, and access to anything the artist can think of?

Aside from the price action being relatively much better than other alts, Ethereum is probably the most reliable out of all chains and will always get the job done at the end of the day.

This is why I’m not too surprised seeing so many whales buying up ETH like its candy. Look at Etherscan and see the top 50 accounts and how much they’re stacking up. BitDAO alone has been adding more than 360 ETH on a DAILY basis and has already accumulated more than $500 million worth of ETH in its treasury.

What was your first reaction to NFTs? I remember that my friend told me that NFTs are ""entertainment for the wealthy people"" lol.   


I must say that I didn't see the good side of NFTs, what changed my mind (but I still agree with the thing I wrote above about BAYC and profile pics) not so long ago was the use of NFTs in the ticketing system, well, that's something with a good purpose I must say.  


Have you considered this? What are your thoughts on which types of NFTs give the greatest purpose?  


I was looking for some pretty good time to find a cause of NFT (they're like the coolest thing in GameFi but I was curious where could be used as well) and finally, when I saw all these advantages of NFT TiX and what they would offer to their clients, I thought that these types of NFTs will certainly stay and become very popular and useful.  


Are you willing to try these NFT tickets? As I learned about them, they're awesome when it comes to preventing the black market, all kinds of hacks, and for fans that are memorabilia, something that could be worth so much as time pass.

In other words, the long-held gamer idea of earning money from computer games has finally come true.  


Players compete for rewards in these games, which may be cryptocurrencies or NFTs that represent in-game commodities like firearms, participant ""skins,"" or car components, as in the upcoming game K4 Rally.  


It's all so great because these rewards can be swapped for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens on third-party exchanges, giving gamers an opportunity to cash out and pay for their gaming efforts.  


The bulk of crypto video games is created on the Ethereum blockchain due to its first-mover advantage. As the first blockchain with adequate contract capabilities, Ethereum has attracted hundreds of decentralized apps as well as large development and consumer community.  


However, developers are experiencing issues with high gas prices (as usual) that clients pay on every transaction, and these transactions can normally take several hours to complete. So, what do you think is the best option here?

What's the reason why is this happening? Does anyone know?  


Since May 12, L2 costs have dropped significantly in the previous five days. For example, using the Metis Network costs about $0.02 for each transfer and about $0.10 to swap tokens.   


While Metis is the most affordable L2, Loopring transfer costs are $0.03 per ether transfer, and token exchanging via Loopring will cost roughly $0.52.

They offer APR for their Earn Plus is 13% with stable daily interest payments making them some of the highest yields on the market. Withdrawal is possible with no additional fees. What’s great about them is that they don’t use a lending-borrowing model which (Celsius and Nexo use).

[Rocketpool](https://rocketpool.net/)

A staking pool. The pool you sent your eth to accumulates over time, their rEth token naturally increases in ratio to Eth. I can buy rEth on Uniswap at L1/L2 or mint fresh rEth for Eth on the rocketpool.net website.

[Nexo](https://nexo.io/)

I like their interest rate and the interface.They offer 8% APY on ETH (and BTC). Interest is paid daily with no fees on withdrawals. They have a rewards system for their APY and even have their own Nexo Token.

[Celsius](https://celsius.network/)

They offer 7.87% APY on BTC as of this writing. They use their holdings to lend to institutions and individuals. You can also trade with Celcius you can do this by buying coins in Coinbase and then transfer to your Celsius wallet.

The pay2post poll sounds promising but I’m afraid the spammers will start targeting the daily thread.  

I propose the minimum account karma be no less than 500 and minimum account age be 1 month.  

Most spammers I see have less karma than the proposed amount.  The 1 month account age requirement would stop those who use free karma subs from achieving the 500 karma minimum in a couple hours.  It would also help stop alt account upvotes/downvotes.  These thresholds can be lowered or raised as the community sees fit.

#EDIT 5/18/2022 7:30pm US Central Time:

• The reason for this change to the proposal is to protect genuine newcomer’s ability to interact in r/ethtrader.  **Minimum account age and account post karma thresholds will only be required to start earning donuts.**

• Most of the major spammers/bots responsible for taking half of the last distribution have high comment karma but low post karma, and have an account less than 60 days old.  **For this reason the thresholds will be changed to 1000 post karma and a minimum account age of 60 days.** *With an additional clause that these thresholds may be subject to change at discretion of the moderators*, so that we won’t need a completely new governance proposal to restructure the minimum account age/post karma requirements.

Members would vote on ideas to be written into scripts and then sold to studios, OR with enough in the treasury, could pay to produce it ourselves. Would be like a decentralized Netflix. 

A pilot for a show only costs about $100k-$200k to make, and even before producing the pilots directly, the DAO could make a return by funding scripts and then selling them, and reinvesting the funds into other scripts or pilots. It could also be a cool way to fund independent film makers and breakout talent. 

The idea is obviously not fully flushed out but if anyone is interested in discussing this further, DM me!

Edit:

There have been some comments on the feasibility of the quoted cost above. I don’t want this thread to turn into arguments over how much it costs to make a pilot, and I think many of the comments below are coming from a US-centric frame of reference, and not considering costs of production using local teams in places like Thailand, etc… But I acknowledge that my initial guess could be way off in general, and is certainly way off for using any major US/Hollywood or similar crews. 

The point of this post is not to put forward a perfect idea, but to see if there are like minded individuals who are interested in discussing different ways to restructure existing systems in ways that could benefit us all.

Maybe even breaking the $5k barrier?,0.125,0.875,0.0,-0.2168,"Overnight, unfavorable risk factors for Ethereum decreased dramatically. The most major event was Turkey's veto of Sweden and Finland joining NATO, which will delay their membership for at least a year, thereby eliminating the prospect of Russian reprisal. After a fresh EU sanctions package was offered, Hungary vetoed any combined EU oil embargoes against Russia, which was a second fuse that was defused. This will make it hard for the EU to impose further measures before the end of the summer.  


While a result, the price of ETH has two important tail risks that have already been deferred for several months, allowing risk assets to gain as the US dollar weakens. Expect a 25% rise this week to $2,682.70, but as a time frame of many months has opened with only upside possibilities, a rally to $4,951.83 appears feasible. As the demand for ETH grows, expect a major lack of supply. Is this hinting that ETH-based initiatives such as NFT communities like High Sloth Society, BAYC, and others will be driven high by the rise of ETH?  


Retaliation by Russia against Finland and Sweden poses a concern since they are now exposed by their pledge to join NATO, while they cannot depend on NATO's assistance due to Turkey's opposition. A military escalation in the North may pose a huge danger to the markets, causing the dollar to surge to parity versus the euro, causing another selloff in cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum likely to plummet to $1,688.39. Another danger that might drive the price of ETH to $1,400 is if the Federal Reserve hikes rates even more hawkishly and fast, frightening investors away from risk assets.",0.113,0.821,0.066,-0.9153,2,0

How long do you think the general drop in cryptocurrencies will take?",0.079,0.825,0.096,0.1179,"Vitalik Buterin withdrew 30,000 ETH from his public wallet today, fueling investor skepticism. Proponents anticipate that the sale of 30,000 ETH by Buterin will have a negative impact on the Ether price.

The co-founder of Ethereum has alarmed investors by transferring 30,000 ETH tokens from one of his multisig wallets. Buterin has previously used the destination wallet to make sales, gifts, and charitable donations.

Buterin's multisig wallet ""Vb 3"" noted a 30,000 ETH transfer to an unidentified wallet.

The public wallet address now holds 290,000 ETH, which is interpreted as a bearish move or as Vitalik Buterin cashing out his Ethereum. While simply transferring a cryptocurrency from one wallet to another is not considered an indicator, Buterin's transfer is out of his Ethereum holdings. 

Proponents believe he may wish to sell a portion of the 30,000 ETH.

Ethereum is currently trading at around $2,086. At this rate, the transferred ETH is worth approximately $62.58 million. If these tokens are listed on an exchange, there may be a significant increase in selling pressure on the altcoin, causing prices to fall. 

Even though the token has retraced more than 50% of its all-time high, John Roque, an analyst at 22V Research, believes Ethereum remains bearish. According to Roque,

The analyst believes Ethereum price could plummet another 80% from the current price levels and target $420. 

The truth is there is almost no crypto including those with large ecosystems like Solana which saw major rise in value in 2021 and Exeno whose ecosystem including access to NFTs and a staking platform; unaffected by the current bitcoin drop. Bitcoin has seen a major drop from 68,000 to 25,000 before it climbed back to 30,000.",0.056,0.88,0.064,0.2944,59,0

Usually they get buried, as clearly they are not very popular.

But with the new proposal (pay 250 donuts to post), the new proposal may favor such advertisers (who  should be more willing than normal posters to pay 250 donuts to do their advertising).

**Prime Example:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/u5u5mx/is\_staking\_crypto\_a\_first\_step\_to\_your\_first/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/u5u5mx/is_staking_crypto_a_first_step_to_your_first/)

Then, we notice the sole hyperlink links to ""Midas Finance"".

2022-05-17 15:26:29,uroxit,0.9962,Introducing Swap.Dance – Proof of Trade AMM.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"[Swap.Dance](https://swap.dance/) is an Ethereum dApp which allows anyone to swap ERC20 tokens and ETH with low slippage. Proof of Trade concept provides a new type of staking mechanism for LP providers. Smart contracts were deployed on [Vyper v0.3.3](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper) and are immutable and not upgradeable. [Github](https://github.com/swapdance).

The protocol is divided into several parts that are interconnected using commands that redirect control flows.

&#x200B;

1. DANCE token.
2. AMM for stable and dynamic market
3. The Proof of Trade Staking
4. The Super Pool

&#x200B;

**The AMM part** has two types of pools - stable and dynamic. Users are free to choose the market type when they create a new liquidity pool. If the created pair has any of pre-approved tokens (list: WBTC, WETH, DAI, USDT, USDC.) in a bundle, that allows anyone to initialize Proof of Trade staking contract for this liquidity pool.

**The Proof of Trade (PoT)** provides a new mechanism of staking. Rather than a traditional staking, that is based on the timeline, the PoT protocol uses a count of trades that have been made on AMM to generate new DANCE tokens. That means that only pairs with high trading volume generate more reward tokens, unlike pairs with low trading activity. The entire reward is divided equally among all PoT stakers depending on staked LP amount. Additional benefit is that you don't need to lock up your LP for any time period, so you can unstake at any time.

**The Super Pool** collects a small percentage ONLY from profits of each liquidity pool. For the dynamic market it's 3.709% and 1.665% for stable pair. According to my calculations, for 1 million trades of the approved pairs, the DANCE contract will mint around 29963 DANCE tokens. Also, each $1,000,000 profit will generate $37,097 (dynamic) and $16,650 (stable) fees to the Super Pool. Users can use DANCE to claim a set of 10 different assurance tokens that are collected in the Super Pool in the distribution period.

**The DANCE** is the utility token of the Swap.Dance protocol which represents the right to access the services on the platform. The token supply depends directly on the trading volume and locked liquidity.

**Things You Can Do With Swap.Dance AMM:**

1. Token swaps.
2. LP staking.
3. Claim a set of 10 different assurance tokens that are collected in the Super Pool!

**Give us feedback!**

What are your thoughts about it?  


All of this points to VR and AR moving beyond their current specialized applications and becoming everyday technology on which we will all rely.  


We may infer Facebook's vision for the metaverse by examining its current approach to social media. It has transformed our online lives into a massive cash stream centered on power, control, and surveillance, all fueled by our data.  


Do you honestly trust that your data and privacy will be protected there?  


I was wondering whether we might tackle this problem using one of the various blockchain tools and platforms that we now have. I mean, just as Modex blockchain is used by many large companies for data and privacy protection, would it be possible for us, average users, to be protected in Metaverse using these platforms?  


What's really disturbing about this is that the way you move your body is so distinctive that VR data may be used to identify you, much like a fingerprint. That means that anything you do in VR might possibly be linked to your personal identity. It's a tempting possibility for Facebook, a digital advertising empire founded on collecting our data.

Remember that one of the explanations, why crypto's not ever gonna be used as regular money, was mostly ""people don't even use them to pay for things and mostly treat them like stocks-buying them up and selling them at a future profit when the time is right"", well, well, well, what do we have now?

Crypto is being used in many restaurants, hotels, and airlines, for purchasing high fashion clothes, Unicoins for investing in Unicorn companies, WordPress websites using Dogecoin payments, famous people promote crypto, and even the famous Los Angeles Lakers  Staples Center is no longer Staple center but rather the Crypto.com Arena.

So, do we really treat crypto like stocks? Nah, I don't think so, that's something we did in past, but things are way different now. So, it wouldn't be a surprise that in the future cryptocurrencies really replace cash, that's my personal opinion.

What do you think about that, can you imagine that we may use cryptocurrencies for groceries, bills, and regular stuff?

Believe me, I know that in that case it will require HUGE effort for the world to adapt and I'm aware of what I'm talking about.

There are numerous reasons why it is not a good idea at all. How are you handling the entire situation?

There were several points where I thought that I'll quit tbh, especially when I realized that I would have all these issues with high gas fees and slow transactions, that was so annoying at the begging, I felt helpless and I even thought that I'll spend bigger amount of money on gas fees than on buying another Ethereum lol.

How did you feel when you dealt with this problem at the beginning?

Unfortunately, I didn't know anyone who is working with Ethereum at that time, so I had no luck hearing a piece of good advice, I was on my own. Thanks to some guys here at Reddit, who helped me a lot when they introduce me to L2 platforms, now I use Metis and I must say that these L2 solutions are something without which you can't deal with gas fees.

That's the reason why I'm writing this, cause probably most of these people who started to sell Ethereum and are scared that they'll lose everything are new here. All of these are not gonna last, soon we will have a merge and things are going to be so much easier. When you're investing in crypto time and patience is everything.

Just keep in mind that we're talking about the second biggest crypto, the majority of stablecoins are placed on Ethereum, Ethereum has the most developers working on its blockchain, and Ethereum dominates the NFT space, dApps, DAOs, and so on. So there's no need to worry.

On the other hand, in POW miners are forced to sell most of their rewards back into the market to pay for energy and hardware, which improves the distribution within the system.
