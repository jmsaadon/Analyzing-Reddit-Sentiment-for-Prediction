I am new to this sub and pretty new to crypto as well. To be honest I probably have a 8% understanding of crypto currencies, the blockchain, virtual wallets - etc.

I’m putting that number so low because the research I’ve been doing has if anything shown me that to be successful at trading ETH one should be very informed and have meaningful understandings of all the different platforms and procedures for buying, storing and diversifying one’s assets.

With all this being said, I am trying to get my dad to better understand the value (and risks involved) of trading ETH because I think if he actually understood it he could be interested in investing in a serious fashion (and possibly give me a loan to invest as well).

My father is a traditional stock trader who mostly deals in IPOs and previously managed a hedge fund with around  100 million in assets. He’s almost 70 years old and started trading in 1998 and made most of his money in the first 3 years. His assets are probably worth around $19 million, mostly in the form of private and one commercial properties.

The point of all of this is to say that he is not afraid to take risks and I think I could convince him to invest at least a few thousand dollars in ETH but I need help convincing him to do so, and so I am asking if anyone has any resources they could share that make understanding the function, history and ultimately value of ETH easier for someone who just found out what NFTs are a month ago. 

I hope this post doesn’t sound too naive and I truly appreciate any advice or resources anyone has to share offer .

Cheers, and thank you so much .

Do you think whales are affecting the prices of Ethereum?,0.091,0.864,0.045,-0.2732,"According to U-Today https://www.google.com/amp/s/u.today/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-explains-how-we-can-prevent-whales-from-dominating-in-staking%3Famp 

Many Ethereum (ETH) supporters are worried about the potential centralization of the ETH2 staking process. As a result, they are debating how to prevent the 'oligarchs' from gaining control.

Pseudonymous Ethereum (ETH) enthusiast Superphiz.eth, an activist in the Ethereum Beacon Chain community, has taken to Twitter to express his concerns about the forthcoming ETH2 network's centralization. 

Who will be the first staking provider to officially promise to not operating more than 22 percent of the validators on the chain? Who do you want to see step up and put beacon chain health ahead of profits?

He is speculating on which pool will be the first to limit its own staking'power' (share of controlled validators participating in signing Ethereum (ETH) transactions) to, say, 22% of all validators.

This choice may reduce the income of this 'pioneer,' but it will tremendously benefit the network as a whole by minimizing the risk of a 51 percent attack. 

Vitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, provided a 'economical' justification for this limit. It appears logical for him to raise costs for staking pool participants who control more than 15% of the network.

Once the'share' of this or that pool falls below 15%, the fees can be adjusted back to'regular' levels.

It should be noted that Ethereum (ETH) - even in its Proof-of-Work (PoW) version - is criticized for 'centralization': huge mining pools control the vast majority of its hashrate. 

As previously reported by U.Today, the Cardano (ADA) community encountered similar challenges following the debut of ADA staking. Input Output Global (IOG) gradually adopted a variety of restrictions to make staking through huge pools less profitable. It remains to be seen how the crypto decline will affect coins like Zetrix that has an ecosystem comprising of NFTs; Solana that saw a major rise in value in 2021 and so on.

By modifying the so-called k-parameter in 2021, tiny and medium pools were able to exceed the top ten staking whales in terms of ADA staked.",0.033,0.866,0.101,0.9575,3,0

One of the key features of Ethereum 2.0 is sharding, a way to split the workload so that transaction requests can be processed in parallel. In addition, the Ethereum 2.0 update will use proof-of-staking (PoS) instead of proof-of-work (PoW) when validating transactions and blocks.

However, as of today there are already proprietary blockchains or blockchian developments that have allowed to operate other cryptoassets with almost zero fee compared to ETH, such as BSC, Solana (its main enemy) or even projects like Zetrix that developed the cross-blockchain, which allows the crossing between one blockchain to another.

For the planned improvements to the network include reduced transaction fees, improved speed and better scalability. The upgrade is currently under development and is expected to be implemented in stages over the next few years. 

Scalability has always been one of Ethereum's biggest challenges. This is especially true for developers looking to build DApps and DeFi platforms on the blockchain, as transaction costs can be prohibitive.

However, with the release of Ethereum 2.0 (which introduces a new PoS consensus mechanism and shard chains), it will finally be possible to scale the network in a way that significantly reduces costs and facilitates faster transactions.

Currently, the network can only handle 15 transactions per second. 
Ethereum 2.0 aims to increase this number exponentially to around 150,000 by the time the upgrades are fully implemented. If this becomes a reality, Ethereum will undoubtedly become one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains out there, which should further increase its popularity.",0.007,0.892,0.101,0.9741,49,0

According to FXStreet https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/why-ethereum-price-could-fall-to-1-000-202205142153 

On the 2-day chart, Ethereum price has produced a highly lethal-looking bearish engulfing candle. The ETH price is currently trading at $2,000, barely above the settling price of the preceding candle. Early buyers may be surprised in the following days as the price continues to plummet in a freefall pattern towards $1400. If the technicals are true, the Ethereum price might stage a countertrend rally before going below $1,000. 

The price of Ethereum has experienced a large surge in negative volume, further complicating the notion of a $1,000 price goal. The bears have left a characteristic ramping pattern on the volume indicator, which can be used to predict future drops. If the technicals are true, a chance to short the ETH price could present itself in the coming days. 

A break below $2,660 confirms the bearish downtrend. If the bulls can break over this level, the bearish double zig-zag thesis will be proven false. The bulls could then aim for a $3,000 price target, which would represent a 33% increase over the current Ethereum price.

It is evident that most cryptos follow the rise and drop of the Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s next movement is unknown but is expected to drop. This will affect all cryptos including Solana which saw a major rise in 2021 and Quint which has a relatively large ecosystem.

I've recently learned about them and what they're used for, but they've confused me a little. What I've found out about them is that privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that preserve users' anonymity by concealing money flow throughout their networks. They make determining who sent what to whom difficult, which is useful if you don't want anyone listening in on your financial dealings.

They are fascinating, to be sure, but why would anybody consider using them when we have all of these data/privacy safeguards like Modex and analogous ones?

I've heard that there are even systems that secure your files, not just smart data, but normal files like jpg, mp4, and so on. So, what's the story behind these coins? Do they merely secure the transportation of your money and have no data protection, for example?

It has gone a long way in the last several decades. Indeed, the worldwide gaming business is expected to be valued at USD 314.40 billion by 2026, up from USD 173.70 billion in 2020, with a 9.64 percent CAGR between 2021 and 2026. If you ask me, it is a significant distinction.  


The majority of the credit belongs to technological innovation. The introduction of VR, AI, and AR, as well as its integration with game consoles such as Xbox and PS5, has transformed the gaming experience into something previously inconceivable.  


Blockchain and cryptocurrency are already influencing the gaming industry with innovations and utilities that benefit both gamers and gaming firms. A fresh wave of upheaval is on its way.  


With games like K4 rally, the first rally blockchain game, we changed the gaming landscape when it comes to racing/motorsport games; it's no longer about NFS or similar games when we now have these types of games where you can even have direct contact with real rally racers, which I believe is something that people are looking forward to.

Analysts believe Ethereum is now nearing its transition to proof-of-stake, as well as improvements to gas costs that will benefit its cryptocurrency — even as competing DeFi blockchains close in on it. The switch to proof-of-stake could help improve congestion, which is why experts are optimistic.

According to sources, the firm teamed up with Nasdaq to establish XTAGE, a digital asset trading platform. It'll be fully integrated into the XP ecosystem and ready to use by the end of the month.

Users will be able to exchange the two most popular cryptocurrencies by market capitalization – bitcoin and ether – at first. XP clients will have immediate access from the firm's application, according to CFO Bruno Constantino. It will eventually be open to outside investors.

The CEO said that ""where the market is [in terms of pricing] is immaterial to the introduction of the exchange:""
""The launch date is dependent on the creation of a platform that provides the client with security, scalability, and speed.""

Lucas Rabechini, Director of Financial Products, also commented on the relationship. He claimed that the current state of the bitcoin market is unimportant to XP. According to him, the specialty has the potential to grow, thus the broker is concentrating on the next five to ten years.

The bank, based in Sao Paulo, is one of South America's premier fintech organizations. It has offices in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and even Berlin, Germany's capital. Nubank has approximately 50 million customers and is worth more than $55 billion.


In my opinion adoption of cryptocurrencies by financial and commercial institutions helps to streamline mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and build trust with the general public that are too sacred to invest in Bitcoin , Ether or other cryptocurrencies. I think people would were doubtful of the viability of cryptocurrencies would be more willing to buy and save in them if their bank offers such crypto  services. 

We have seen more and more people enter into the Blockchain ecosystem to take make use and participate on innovative platforms in the blockchain ecosystem  such as Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses, Deedy an NFT platform  where users can trade, rent out, view, buy, sell, enter NFT lotteries, support and connect with creators, Luckyblock which  is a digital asset project that decentralizies the lottery process via blockchain technology,  Blanksoles is a platform for sneakerheads to launch both physical and digital collections. The growling popularity of these blockchain based platforms coupled with the fact that cryptocurrencies are utilized to perform transactions on them is enough incentive for financial institutions to grab a chunk of the crypto market. 

I think that has cryptocurrencies continue to be adopted by financial institutions and more people opt to use them in place of fiat their value will only grow overtime although with the expected price swings

For example, if $100 of atom on terra gets liquidated, the person getting liquidated receives 100 UST regardless of the price. By bidding on liquidations, you can essentially get wrapped assets(ethereum, avax, solano, etc) you can bridge out of terra, and take a maybe 5% loss instead of 80% with UST

First and foremost, I just wanted to say the last couple of days have been incredibly stressful for the Terra community in its i entirety, I wanted to say that if anyone needs any help with anything, or just wants to talk, my dms are always open. 

Now a little information about liquidations on terra; there are basically 3 protocols: kujira, lighthouse, and terra toolbox. Kujira is by far the most established, and was what I had used but I’m pretty sure the other 2 work as well. Liqudations are first come first serve with the 0% pool being filled before the 1% and 2% and so on, until 30%, which is the absolute max that can be filled. Bids are filled proportionally to your bid size/the total bid size, so if you bid $1,000 and someone bids $100,000, and the pool gets 50% filled, you’d get 50% or $500 of your bid filled 

Anyway, here’s my crazy story of how I was able to turn around 11,000 UST into close to $40,000 using the little oracle trick I mentioned above. Basically, my tale started on the morning of may 10th, right as the Luna dump began. People didn’t really believe in the UST peg and the whole market (LUNA in particular) was dumping super hard. The problem was, as LUNA decreased dollar by dollar, more and more BLUNA(bonded Luna that can be used as collateral on anchor protocol) began to become liquidated 

Initially, it wasn’t that big of a deal, Luna was being bought up, but soon it began to spiral out of control. I was liquidating some LUNA on kujira, bidding in the 7% out of 30% pools. This was back when UST was in the high 90 cents, there was a lot of UST in the deep end of the liquidation bidding pool, and soon the death spiral began, and more and more bluna was being liquidated. I personally was buying Luna at a discount and then reselling it on astroport, and making a nice profit on it. When the latter pools (20% and over) began to get hit, shit became serious 

Since people sold their discounted Luna (by bidding at a x% premium), they were essentially getting an x% profit at once, and this caused a death spiral. At one point, I had bids in the 30% premium (which was the max) get hit. Around then, I’d essentially turned that 11K into 35k. I got greedy and kept going, and Luna kept dumping, until bluna was trading at well >40% from its peg, LUNA.

At that point, I decided to cut my losses and lost 2K, but salvaged around 33K and let it sit on anchor, hoping the peg would restabalize and I’d be able to go to ethereum with my profit. I went to bed, and when I woke up the next day, the peg was chugging around the .8-.9 zone, and even hit .93. After a bit, Luna basically became a penny stock, and this when I decided I need to get the fuck out of terra.

I began looking at all my options, bridging out via ethereum, etc. and that was when I noticed a little something on the kujira dashboard: Beth(which is LIDO’s steth on terra) was trading for 2300~ UST. UST was clearly off peg, and I wondered if I could swap my ust 1:$1 for Beth. People were front running each other in the BETH liquidation pool, and there were even bids in the 0% pool (which is unprofitable af, since 0.5% of all liquidation fees go to kujira token holders) and that was when I noticed something was amiss.

I placed a UST to test things out, and it got partially filled. Moment of truth, I held my breath while I crunched up the numbers, and sure enough, 1 UST = $1. Seemingly, a couple of big UST holders noticed this and we’re bidding in the 0% pool. I went to bed and woke up, and around 1/2 of the bid I placed was somehow filled. I saw the lido tweet about it being unsafe to hold Beth and rushed  to get it off chain. I managed to bridge the sTETH out.

Sadly, the rest of my sTETH bid wasn’t getting filled and the next day (today) I once again, began looking for ways to exit with the rest of my UST. Then, around noon, kujira said it was closing shop, and everyone should sell their KUJI tokens. The way the kujira pool works was they had 0.5% of all liquidated assets available to stakers proportional to their KUJI share. There was a bonding cooldown to stop people from arbitraging and using the pool as a dex, but the team lifted it. 

I realized that you could essentially arbitrage kujira, and essentially gain a % of the pool, which if you did repeatedly, meant gaining a lot of Beth. After arbitraging the pool a bit, I gained a good amount of Beth, and I jumped ship as fast as the little bridge could process my transaction. Overall, I made it out pretty unscathed (apart from all the time I spent glued to the terra/ust charts), and turned 11,000 UST into $40K in 3 days, and got it into something that isn’t imploding or printing out trillions every day

If you’ve made it this far, I hope you enjoyed it. It’s really crazy that I’ve made this much without shorting, and was able to get out at 10x the current peg. You probably can as well, as long as there are BASSETS on anchor protocol. Liqudity is drying up, but there’s still a couple 10 million worth of Beth, wasavax, batom and solano, and if you bid in the 0% pools, you might just be able to get your ust swapped for Bassets and maybe take a 5-25% loss from a market dip, vs holding a depreciating stablecoin. If the mods want to see proof, I’d be glad to share my terra/ether wallet with em, and anyone can check any liquidation platform on terra + anchor protocol and see my story checks out. Once again, if anyone wants to talk or has any questions, my dms are open, and maybe anchor wants to give me a bug bounty for noticing this /s",0.058,0.86,0.082,0.9812,27,0

The main argument for the adoption of crypto in the financial world comes from the fact it cannot be manipulated in a centralized way. 

There is a soundness to crypto that is (supposed to be) based on the ruthless pragmatism of the source code in the chain. But with the rise in popularity of crypto have come a lot of con artist more interested in the hype than the technology underlying crypto. Well, now is the time of reckoning, the storm that will knock down all the poorly built houses, but will also tell us which ones are solid. 

Even within Ethereum, it was clear to many that although the defi and NFT features have a lot of potential, the concept was sold before being mature enough. It was like if we discovered the magic of 3D printers and started “printing” all the possessions of our dreams, and now we are realizing your plastic 3D printed lambo can’t actually drive. 

This doesn’t mean a lambo will never be 3D printed, but it does mean decoupling our valuation of the technology from reality will ultimately cause disappointment.

Even a significant participant such as Ethereum is susceptible to the crash. In recent days, the cryptocurrency has lost value as a big chunk of the market continues to decline. Ethereum is currently trading at roughly $2,000 per token. Since July 2021, this is the highest pricing.

Investors who are unsure what triggered the cryptocurrency meltdown might blame a variety of factors. The persistent economic pressure is one example. This is due to rising interest rates, rising prices, recession talk, and the Russian-Ukraine conflict. 

It's fair that traders are curious about the future of cryptocurrency in the wake of the recent crisis.

According to Marca https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2022/05/13/627dbc03ca47417f7a8b4608.html, The announcement has generated debate over whether the market has reached the projected cooling period, termed ""crypto winter,"" or a longer-term freeze, dubbed ""crypto ice age."" 

""Bitcoin continued to tumble and ended below $30,000 for the first time since July,"" Yuya Hasegawa, a crypto market analyst at Bitbank, wrote in an emailed note viewed by Forbes. 

The fact that big players are starting to join the party may offer crypto investors hope.

A regulatory swat might drive even the littlest of cryptocurrencies including Solana which saw a 1400% increase in 2021 before the general crypto decline and Quint which has a large ecosystem comprising of NFTs, NFT marketplace and a superstaking platform; considerably lower, whereas timely choices could maintain any underlying value. 

The future appears to be uncertain: either a brief winter respite or an epoch-ending ice age appear to be viable options. There will be no single currency or platform that can endure it.",0.092,0.818,0.09,-0.4201,18,0

So, this implies that customers who paid a lot of money for one of the digital assets are trapped with it in just one game that no longer receives fresh material from the publisher, similar to what occurs with more traditional virtual gaming gear when a game goes down. This may hurt individuals who paid a premium sum for an NFT.  


I recall having a plan to check out F1, but thank heavens another NFT game, K4 Rally, blew my mind and completely distracted me just as I found out that F1 was closing down.

What do you think, what could be the reason? Do you think that ETH holders are feeling insecure when it comes to these crypto price swings?  


Ether whales made a total of 2,956 transactions, each valued at over $1 million on Wednesday, marking the highest day of whale transactions in nearly five months (whales are typically defined as any account holding between $1 million to $10 million).   


Did any of you do some recent transactions?  


We had so many worries lately, high gas fees, and now all the crypto scene feels insecure, people started using now even more L-2 solutions, I personally rely for months on Metis, and these L2 platforms provide me to feel more secure when it comes to lower gas prices and faster transactions.

What do I take away from this:

- if you don’t understand how something works down to the bone then come to terms with that risk. It’s ok to take risks….

- avoid projects where the leadership is unknown or have less than desirable views/ideas/incentives/goals/behaviours

Do Kwon came across as an arrogant ass in every interview I watched. It was not subtle. I can think of a few other founders that give me that vibe.

If they can’t discuss their project openly and acknowledge weaknesses or downsides then I’m not on board. Maybe you can’t be out there in the market doing that as a founder though?

Humility, curiosity, integrity and accountability are my checkpoints to jump on board a project - anyone else have any thoughts on this? Might be horrible traits for the necessary pumping of a project I guess….

I can think of a clear example that shows I am wrong in Elon Musk so I’ll cop that. Although he seems like an ass he is operating at a much higher level than almost anyone else and has delivered beyond expectations as far as I can tell.

Don’t get me wrong, Ethereum isn’t in a good place right now. In fact, it’s in one of its worst stages its been in a long while. But when you compare it to other chains like Solana or Cardano, it holding up WAY better.

The fact is, the main selling point of these “ETH killers” is that they’re cheaper and faster but the reality is that a lot of them are unreliable like Solana or have a very poor ecosystems like Cardano

Meanwhile Ethereum has a bunch of dedicated scaling solutions that compensate for gas fees and low TPS.
Polygon alone has put up more than 6 multipurpose scaling solutions since 2021 dedicated to scale Ethereum and it already has a much better and diverse ecosystem than both Solana and Cardano combined with more than 18,000 dApps on the chain. If anything both Ethereum and Polygon independently have more daily active users than all other supposed “ETH killers”

What do you think?  


I'm aware that cryptocurrency is valuable. I found one example where one guy was paid like  $13 million in bitcoin in 2010, and that would be worth billions of dollars today. Well, that's pretty cool.  


These days we have so many opportunities with crypto, there are more and more places where we can pay something in crypto, airplane tickets, restaurants, hotels, and fashion brands, and all of them started to accept ETH, BTC, and other cryptocurrencies as a way of payment. There are as well Unicoins if you're interested in investing in some growing companies, so we have plenty of opportunities to use a huge number of cryptocurrencies. But...  


But this is why I believe it is still too early to be paid in cryptocurrency because if a person wishes to spend all of their money on domestic items such as rent, utilities, food, and entertainment, receiving payment in cryptocurrency is not highly useful because the majority of the merchants they would have to pay will not accept cryptocurrency. Customers would instead have to trade their tokens for fiat currency, paying exchange service fees and maybe even tax fees depending on where they live.  


One thing I don't get is when we have a situation like today when cryptocurrencies are dropping, does it indicate that salary, if paid in crypto, would also rise or fall?

This poll would be about donut issuance halving.

This would not involve liquidity providing on mainnet and gnosis, because I think those are still low, so just the issuance from 4m/month to 2m/month.

As I see, the majority of the sub is just dumping the farmed donuts instantly, we can see this on the price, so I think a lot of us would vote ""YES"" to this proposal who are hoarding donuts for governance/tipping or just because its a nice meme token :)

We could maybe incentivize a lot more people to COLLECT and USE donuts, not just FARM it for a few dollars every month with this poll.  
Poll:

Should we halve the monthly issuance from 4m to 2m donuts?

1. \[Yes\] I support the ""HALVE"".
2. \[No\] Issuance should stay at \~4m/month.
3. \[Abstain\] I am not into donuts.

I'm aware that it could potentially change how we interact with each other. The creation of this new space will require overcoming numerous technical and social challenges. However, overcoming them will revolutionize how we experience social media and communicate with each other in general.  


But sometimes that led me to think that maybe we're going to become antisocial, or at the very least less sociable than we are now.  


It's all about connecting the real and virtual worlds for the first time, but tell me honestly why do you think that we need that, for what?  


I even refused to play these metaverse games, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of blockchain games, my fav one is K4 Rally, I play a few of these games, but I was never interested in the metaverse, cause until now I don't see the right reason why would I be.  


What do you think, why we should be attracted to the metaverse project? Why do I need virtual clothes when I can buy the real ones, or why would I attend a metaverse concert when I can attend in person? Sometimes I get that feeling that metaverse is trying to lock people up in houses.",0.033,0.799,0.168,0.9911,2,0

Regardless of how much we like and admire Ethereum, we must be honest about the unpleasant scalability concerns and high gas prices that have made it impossible for the network to expand. I'm supposing that every one of you is using some sort of L2 solution, Metis, or something like that. We're fortunate in that we can select from a variety of these solutions, all of which are quite good and, more importantly, useful.  


We all have seen that Layer-2 transactions are so much easier and less expansive, they become something that we can’t work without. For example, Polygon, and Polkadot are common Ethereum Layer-2 solutions which are great as well. Which one are you using?  


One of the major issues of high prices of gas fees is Ethereum’s popularity, that’s one of the major reasons. That’s why I can’t understand people who are always complaining about this issue, okay, it is annoying but you should know that you’re holding one of the greatest cryptocurrencies ever…  


Some of you may be interested in knowing that, according to analysts, the value of Ethereum will climb 400% by 2022. As you are aware, Ethereum is used by a wide range of DApps, including games, supply chain solutions, and DeFi platforms. So, as I previously stated, the price of gas costs climbs as Ethereum's popularity grows. Miners require more computer power to stay up as more people use the blockchain network, thus transactions with a greater gas cost limit are prioritized.  


What is your solution for avoiding expensive gas fees? I know that some people are doing transactions at a non-peak times, such as on weekends.",0.026,0.798,0.176,0.9903,4,0

For some backstory, I used to spend a lot of time playing online sim type of games like Second Life, Club Penguin, and Roblox when I was younger. My entire group of friends were present. I had a large number of buddies. These games actually became a big part of my life. I even forget to eat at times because I was so hooked on these games.

Fast forward to today with all the metaverse projects that have been popping out, I'm curious to see how it all plays out on a personal level and how it compares to my experience in gaming these virtual sims. They are welcome to try to create a platform that I would want to spend any considerable amount of time on in my opinion. But, if the status of social media is any indicator, corporate interests will dominate, and they will not be discreet about it.

Eventually started going up again, get back to 6.3K and now we are here, 6 mini dips followed by a huge crash again, now I am at around 3.1k.

When the time was right, they called up Do Kwon at Terra Foundation and said they wanted to sell a lot of BTC for UST. As it was a large trade they told him they didn't want to move the market and asked if he would like to buy their large block of BTC at a discount for UST. Do Kwan took the bait. He gave them a huge chunk of UST, thus lowering the UST liquidity significantly. At that point, Blackrock/Citadel dumped all of the BTC and UST causing massive slippage and triggering a cascade of forced selling in both assets. The real problem was Blackrock/Citadel knew that Anchor, which holds a lot of LUNA, was a Ponzi scheme (they offer 20% staking APY for Christsake) and this crash would trigger more withdrawals than Anchor can repay. These forced withdrawals and selling would trigger a massive selloff in Luna, thus further breaking the $1 peg and wrecking the market further.



Blackrock and Citadel can now buy the BTC back cheaply to repay the loan and pocket the difference. Meanwhile, billions of longs and Bitcoin VaR were wiped out.

Between Nov. 10, 2021, when Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,789, and today, its value has declined 51.98 percent.
On the other hand Ethereum follows the same path and is not very optimistic outlook. 

However, if we talk about Ethereum, the blockchain development within its ecosystem has not stopped, because despite the fall, it has been observed how several of its projects such as UniSwap, the first decentralized exchange more important of its network, Yearn Finance the first De-Fi protocol or Shiryo an ecosystem of collectible NFT's with a view to the metaverse, are still standing and still with great profits.

On Nov. 16, 2021, Ethereum peaked at $4,891.70, giving it a market dominance of about 19.2 percent, according to CoinMarketCap

That's why investors may be selling Ethereum through untracked decentralized exchanges (DEX) within the DeFi ecosystem, according to some speculation. Coinbase reported just over $500 million in trading activity for Ethereum, but Uniswap, DeFi's largest decentralized exchange, reports $1.63 billion in trading volume for Ethereum.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have the same level of activity or De-Fi development.

It will be fascinating to watch if buyers can pick up the market at the $2300 level, as they have done in the past. The fact that we are closing at the absolute bottom of this candlestick indicates that negative pressure is more likely than not to persist. The market will most likely attempt to reach $2000 at that point.

The $2000 level is a significant round number that will attract a lot of attention and generate a lot of headline concerns. If the $2000 mark is breached, it will open the door to significantly lower pricing, and I believe we will finally experience what is known as ""crypto winter."" In that case, the market is expected to accelerate significantly, resulting in a large unwinding of long holdings.

It's interesting to see how much we've given up during the day, and the fact that we've formed such a large candlestick suggests that plenty of people will be leaving ship. You should be aware that many institutions have invested in Ethereum which has the largest ecosystem over the likes of Quint and Solana; and are experiencing significant losses not only in this market but also in other markets. When there are losses across the board, these larger funds are often forced to liquidate practically anything they can get their hands on. It's all about trying to discover shards of liquidity at that time.

It's also worth noting that Bitcoin was completely destroyed over the day, and it appears that we're on the verge of another ""crypto winter."" If you're looking for a long-term investment, you should be able to acquire crypto at a far lower price, not just Ethereum. We're probably in a ""do or die"" situation at this point, so pay close attention. Rallies at this point will almost certainly give considerable resistance that we can sell into, but I'm not interested in trying to become long Ethereum right now.",0.094,0.856,0.05,-0.9651,15,0

This proposal seeks to address this by formalizing the process for removing banned users from earning donuts during the distribution period(s) in which they are banned. 


## Motivation & Process 
- Users who have been temporarily or permanently banned from participating in r/Ethtrader have broken some sub rule and should not earn donuts as a result of bad-acting. 


## Specification
- Prior to issuing donuts, the list of users banned during that distribution period will be removed from the list of eligible users.
- Donuts earned by banned users will be removed from the distribution AND not issued. 
- This applies to bans of all durations. In other words, if a users receives a 7 day ban they will earn 0 donuts for the one distribution period in which they are banned. If a user receives a 30 day ban, they will receive 0 donuts for the two distributions period in which they are banned.



## Poll Options
The poll options would be:

**[Yes]** - Remove banned users from donut distributions.

**[No]** - Keep the status quo.

This fee would disincentivize spammers by causing them to sacrifice a large portion of any rewards they earn without putting undue burden on normal and productive sub members. 


## Motivation & Process
- Reduce the proliferation of spam posts for the purposes of donut farming by disincentivizing mass posting of low-quality and low-effort content. As the profitability of spamming low-upvoted posts goes down, the incentive to farm will be reduced.
- Charging a fee for posts will essentially create a new *burn mechanism* in which fewer donuts will be issued during each distribution period. 
- As spam posting is reduced, there will be more opportunity to engage with the quality content that is currently buried under endless memes, tweets, and links. 
- **We do NOT want this to** be a burden on new users, users not registered to receive donuts, or users who post productive and quality content. To that end, this will **in no way impact the process of posting.** All users who meet the karma and age requirement will continue to able to post without any interruption. At the end of each distribution period, the total fee for posting will be deducted from any earnings received, thus only affecting users who are actively engaged in earning donuts. In the event that a user accrues more fees than they earn, they will receive 0 Donuts for that distribution. 
- **How we set the fee:** A *reasonable fee* should allow every registered user the ability to post and earn on quality content, but should be high enough to be a burden to farmers who spam low-effort posts that receive small amounts of upvotes. With that criteria we are proposing to start with a fee of **250 donuts per post**. 
	- On average, r/Ethtrader has about 6,300 posts during each distribution period. While the total number of posts by unregistered users is unknown, it can be assumed that the indicated fee will reduce monthly distributions by 30-40%. 
	- On average, registered users earn about 3,500 donuts per distribution. As the number of spam posts is reduced, there will be less fee pulled out of each distribution and each productive user will end up earning more per post. 
	- **The fee should be increased and/or decreased in the future if it is found too restrictive or ineffective.** 


## Specification
- Each post will incur a fee of **250 Donuts**
- At the end of each distribution, the total number of posts made by each registered user will be tallied and the total fee will be deducted from any earnings received. 
- In order to ensure that spammers don't cheat by deleting old posts, the Automod will create a record of each post/poster for the purpose of tallying fees. 
- Deducted donuts will be removed from the distribution and will **NOT** be issued.
- After fee is taken out of the distribution, the amount mods earn will be recalculated based on the reduced distribution amount. 
- This fee will apply to all posts, regardless of flair type. 
- This fee will **NOT** apply to r/Ethtrader members who are **NOT** registered to receive Donut distributions.
- The fee can be adjusted in the future through a governance poll.


## Poll Options
The poll options would be:

**[Yes]** - Users earning donuts should pay a reasonable fee to post content.

**[No]** - Keep posting free for all users.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of the metaverse, in your opinion?  


We should not forget all of these great aspects of this, and I am looking forward to seeing what the metaverse has in store for us. I feel it is past time to redirect technology toward something beneficial, something that will help people and improve their skills and knowledge.  


There are also several projects interested in developing and improving the metaverse. For all of us who are interested in Ethereum, Metis is developing an L2 to reduce gas costs, while Ethereum's trust may be a suitable entry point for the metaverse's relationship with blockchain. For example, advances in sharding and interoperability allow different environments, assets, and identities to be held on distinct blockchain networks while yet allowing for seamless interaction.

The largest single liquidation order happened on Bitmex - XBTUSD value of $6.30M.

There are a lot of posts like this one about shorts being liquidated and people in the comments celebrating that shorts got ""rekt"".

We have to show that shorts are not the only ones getting rekt, but that the opposite is also true.

Just in the last 24 hours, $1 billion of longs was liquidated.

$700 million was wiped just from BTC, ETH, and LUNA.

Remember, don't over-leverage yourself on short or long, because you can get fucked both ways.

""Miner revenue"" is a significant indicator that just touched a nine-month low. Miners' earnings on the Ethereum network have lately dropped to $1,476,333.1. In March 2021, the previous low was recorded. An increase in selling pressure on the cryptocurrency is caused by a decrease in miner earnings.

To meet their operational expenses, miners sell the asset, resulting to an increase in exchange reserves and selling pressure on the cryptocurrency.

According to statistics from the crypto intelligence portal Glassnode, Ethereum is experiencing more instability. Due to a delay in the ""Merge,"" the move from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, negative market sentiment has dominated for Ethereum. To gain community support, the Ethereum Foundation published a roadmap for the event.

The number of addresses that have been lost has risen to 24.5 million, the highest level since May 2020.

The primary elements impacting Ethereum's recovery, according to supporters, are a mix of increased selling pressure from miners, a large number of addresses in loss, and unfavorable mood among investors.

The changes in these factors can be really unpredictable and that's why you should decide if it's time to stay in ETH or go further with your investments. For now, I keep believing in ETH, but still have a smaller part of my portfolio diversified to some projects that I believe will go high this year. It's mainly ROSE, Cardano, and High Sloth Society, with a small percentage of my portfolio in other projects.

&#x200B;

The last halving was about 2 years ago in May

This poll would be about donut issuance halving.

This would not involve liquidity providing on mainnet and gnosis, because I think those are still low, so just the  issuance from 4m/month to 2m/month. 

As I see, the majority of the sub is just dumping the farmed donuts instantly, we can see this on the price, so I think a lot of us would vote ""YES"" to this proposal who are hoarding donuts for governance/tipping or just because its a nice meme token :)

 We could maybe incentivize a lot more people to COLLECT and USE donuts, not just FARM it for a few dollars every month with this poll.  

Thanks for 420Weedscoopes!(I copied a few things from his proposal :) )  

If we got the greenlight for the poll I will need some help with the snapshot.

 

Poll:

Should we halve the monthly issuance from 4m to 2m donuts?

1. \[Yes\] I support the ""HALVE"".  

2. \[No\] Issuance should stay at \~4m/month.  

3. \[Abstain\] I am not into donuts.

Diversify between all stablecoins and also between platforms.
As we saw a stablecoin can depeg and lose a lot of its value leading to big loses in an asset you thought was safe. 
At the same time if the last mo ths have shown us anything is that everything and anything is hackable

Thus simple logic says:
Dont use  one stablecoin on one platform
Dont use one stablecoin on several platforms
Dont use several stablecoins on one platform.

Have several stablecoins on several different platforms. Easy, but a little bit more work. 

You can easily find a list of platforms i personally use 6 different platforms, some more knowm than others and some more risky.
As for stablecoins i use USDC DAI USDT UST and PAX and have all of them earning an average of 10% APY. 

Yes I also have UST but i knew the risk was higher so my bag is smaller and still chilling on Anchor, calculated risk for 20%, higher yield higher risk. 

Also id like to add thag most platforms offer a sign up bonus when using a referal, sometimes up  50$ for amounts below 1k $. 
Thats money earned out of thin air which you can then add to your assets.

It sounds like something from the Sci-Fi movies, right?  


But believe it or not thanks to the blockchain tech this is possible but it only sounds scary, here's what I've found out about it.   


These days I'm learning a lot of new things about blockchain, whether it's Modex blockchain which many companies use for complex operations or blockchain that resolve some regular house chores, or this one that has an impact on our mind.   


In which sphere or industry do you consider a blockchain a MUST HAVE?   


This new social platform is called Tau and there your profile will be your Worldview. The exact definition of Tau would be ""Tau is the first-ever decentralized blockchain social network able to take the thoughts, advice, and knowledge of its users and update its own code in real-time to give all users control over what the software does for them and how it evolves at any scale"".  


Do you think these are the platforms of the future?  


This one appeals to me since it allows it to grasp the perspectives of its users, which may be beneficial. Imagine if thousands of scientists were given the necessary tools and could efficiently discuss a potential cure for cancer and find the greatest possible answer in record time.

In which case would you like to use it and do you like the idea of living in it?    
 

I know that it will take like 10-15 years for metaverse to be fully developed, but I would like to hear your opinion on that. Do you think that's really going to be as they presented to us, a virtual life with so many opportunities like in the real one?   
 

And I'm curious why would you (the one who's interested) live the virtual life if you have the real one that also offers you so many things? I heard some comments about the opportunity to start over and similar stuff.   
 

When it comes to technical stuff, I guess that blockchain would have the most important role there, who knows what we will be capable of with the blockchain tech for 10-15 years, I can't even imagine. As far as I'm concerned, I'm only using Zenotta's blockchain for converting my files into smart data and I'm happy with it, cause all this metaverse stuff makes me pretty scared lol.   
 

It is obvious that centralized ecosystems carry a lot of risks in terms of the creation and functioning of the virtual world. These can be hacks, malware, and even centralized decision-making regarding the functioning of the metaverse. Blockchain technology, however, minimizes these risks and makes it possible to build a stable virtual ecosystem.   
 

Do you think that younger generations and the ones that aren't born yet will grow up alongside metaverse like some of us did grow up with the internet, Facebook, etc. and metaverse will be their new normality, they'll have the opportunity to live to different lives, a real one and virtual one?",0.028,0.793,0.179,0.9936,7,0

I love how NFTs are making through tickets a direct relationship between artists and fans.   


We can use a music concert as an example. However, by the time you find out about a concert, tickets are already sold out, and the scalped tickets are now being offered on the secondary market, sometimes known as the black market.  


So, how does that go? Simple, ticket scalpers buy a large number of sports and entertainment event tickets with the express intent of reselling them for a substantial profit over the original purchase price.  


It would be smart to look out for NFT ticketing platforms such as NFT TiX for example because this would be certainly the future of the ticketing system. It eliminates the need for a physical ticket and connects users directly to the NFT ticketing marketplace.  


What do you think? I believe this is more than enough motivation to begin utilizing NFT tickets for all potential events.",0.0,0.861,0.139,0.9723,4,0

That led to people buying 3 letter words. LOL, SMH, IBM, ICO, FWB. You name it. Now we are onto 4 digits and 4 letters and beyond. People are scraping anything they can find. Cities, artist, sports teams, counties, brands, etc. etc. etc. 

Obviously all this depends how successful and what is developed on Ethereum in the next years but the bet is on and some are going heavy and when the time comes they wont be releasing these ENS domains for cheap. If you aren't familiar with ENS for example you can register voteforpedro.eth or vote4pedro.eth. Well you can buy it rom whoever owns t by now. They are both taken. These were just examples.

So what do you think of the current ENS frenzy?

We are shifting from the Web 2.0 age, in which social media dominates screens, to the Web 3.0 era, in which the Internet will be based more on blockchain technology.  


Could you compare the rise of blockchain technology to the Internet’s breakthrough during the 1980s? I'm the one who will certainly agree with that, but there are some people who think it’s only a passing fad.  


However, with over 19,000 altcoins in circulation, could it still only be a ‘passing fad’ if the market has become so vast and competitive?   


Blockchain technology is pretty experimental right now and is used predominantly in niche communities, most notably in the cryptocurrency and NFT markets. Many companies are using Modex blockchain for data safety, we may now use blockchain for plenty of great things, not only that companies may implement blockchain tech into their operations, all of us who are regular computer users can.   


A few days ago I learned how big a role blockchain could have in some everyday things we use at home. I'm certain that we would start using blockchain tech more and more. Do you like that idea, since blockchain proved to be very useful and helpful?

What are your thoughts on this sort of game?  


I must admit that it took some time for me to get used to p2e games and all of the possibilities of NFTs in these games. I tried so many of these games looking for the perfect one until I recently discovered K4 Rally (I've always been a racing game fan), so I can't imagine that now I start playing some other types of games as well, it seems too early for that lol.  


I'm kidding ofc, since what I found out was that these are not some regular games, it's all about health, getting yourself into healthier habits, and so on. The industry’s new buzzword follows the p2e model but centers on health and fitness, where users are rewarded for their physical activity.   


Do you think this is too much, do we need this or do you think it's an awesome idea and could be useful? I don't know what to think until I see how they did develop these apps or games, whatever they call them.  


As I figure it out when users play the game, the app tracks their movement through the GPS on their mobile phones and rewards them with in-app tokens, as we have now on our phones that steps counting or something like that, so, maybe it could be fun.

2022-05-09 09:03:13,ulmzmj,0.7389000000000001,What would you single out as the best thing about holding Ethereum?,0.0,0.724,0.276,0.6369,"According to CoinMarketCap, there are currently over 19320 cryptocurrencies in the world. This makes it difficult for investors to determine which ones will be lucrative in the long run. But my favorite is Ethereum, which is not without reason the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market valuation.  


What would you single out as the biggest advantage of Ethereum?  


As we all know there are plenty of benefits, for example, NFTs since Ethereum is the major blockchain where most of the top known nonfungible tokens are launched.   


It's no wonder that people are thrilled about owning Ethereum because the market prediction for NFTs is predicted to reach over $130 billion in sales by 2030, with a 33 percent annual growth rate. This indicates that Ethereum will be in high demand since it is essential to pay fees when producing or purchasing tokens on decentralized platforms such as OpenSea.  


Even if we have to use Metis or other L2 solutions to decrease gas prices, which can be enormous, as the gas fees climb, the price of Ethereum will increase as well since token holders on the Ethereum blockchain require Ethereum to transact on the network.  


What are your thoughts on the news that Ethereum gas fees are predicted to increase by 500% in the next two years? If the price of Ethereum rises proportionally, we should anticipate it to trade for at least $15,000 by the end of 2024.",0.03,0.841,0.129,0.9769,3,0

**Portus** is an `open, trustless, permissionless` API oracle. It is both an Inbound Oracle and an Outbound Oracle with features designed to ensure information validity and action traceability:

* OPEN - built from open source software, available as open source software for full transparency.
* TRUSTLESS - allows seamless public or private interaction within the network without requiring a trusted 3rd party.
* PERMISIONLESS - both consumers and providers can participate without being authorised by a governing body.

Portus is a full-scale API Gateway. It is an API management tool which sits between a client and a collection of 3rd party services. It defines API endpoints that aggregates various external servicves and returns an aggregated results. One main component of the Portus network is the **PORTKEY NODE**. This is a piece of software that is both an **INBOUND** and **OUTBOUND ORACLE**, sitting on the API provider's premises.

[Portus Network released a beta to its API Gateway called Portkey. You can find the beta here along with full documentation and tutorials on how to use it.](https://docs.portusnetwork.org/portkey-getting-started)

Portus Network can processing 65000 transactions per second, is a super fast blockchain oracle.

There are NO MIDDLEMEN in Portus. The consumers are interacting directly with the API providers. There are NO FEES involved, with the exception of gas fees.

The project is currently in a private sale phase, with an upcoming public sale for individuals in Q2/Q3 2022.

What makes it different from other oracle solutions currently available? Additional features that make Portus attractive and unique on the oracle market are the lack of validators and inclusion of an **insurance system.**

**Portus Network should be on your radar if you're interested in Web3. Oracles are an essential component of the future we're heading towards. Portus Network offers great API features, including zero usage fees and an insurance system.**

However, this could be serious, especially since crypto is becoming so common in our daily lives that we can now buy products and some stuff with it (even some schools in Dubai started accepting Bitcoin payments), we can buy houses, and even investing is different, we can invest in Unicorn companies with Unicoins, fashion houses started accepting crypto payments, some restaurants started accepting crypto payments, and so on.  


It's not surprising that some individuals have gotten obsessed with it. I remember having a couple of nightmares involving cryptocurrency charts and thinking to myself, okay, I'm going mad lol.  


What do you think? Could this cryptocurrency obsession grow into some serious addiction such as gambling? However, if we look at it from that angle, you may become addicted to anything if you don't have control over it, therefore maintaining balance in all that we do is the best strategy.",0.071,0.807,0.122,0.9498,3,0

For the first time, I choose to use Netswap, the Metis network, which has a lot of farms and, from what I've seen, APRs of over 500 percent. There are a few steps to take, and they are pretty basic as you will see for yourself, so let's get started!  


Since it runs on the Andromeda network, you must first add the Andromeda network to the Chain list, and then bridge over the token you choose at the start to the Metis network. You link your wallet and pay the charge, however, you should be aware that you must pay a fee in Metis tokens when you bridge back.  


Now, how can you obtain a Metis token without switching and incurring exorbitant gas fees? You might utilize the Metis faucet, and then to complete the procedure, you should swap first, then go to the pool to add liquidity, and after you do so, you will earn pool tokens, and then you left to do to stake these tokens you have.    


Quick note: in order to bridge out of the Metis Network, you must have Metis tokens on the Andromeda Network.  
If you want to give it a shot, maybe this information may benefit you, as it did for me!

But how do ZK proofs practically work in a private chain?

As I see it the Blockchain is like a paper. Each node is a copy of the piece of paper and transactions are validates across nodes. With ZK proofs, is all the transaction data (who is sending what to who, how much is in each wallet, who requested the info and who verified it), is that all private or is the meta data still exposed?  
If the above is the case, why isn't ZK used in all cases on all blockchains?

Is all the validation or just the info sent to companies private?

That was like a whole new level of NFTs, soon after that, I was so into these types of tickets and trying to find all these events and marketplaces that are selling these tickets.  


You may recall that the NBA was an early adopter of Top Shot, and basketball clubs had greater leeway. For example, Mark Cuban's Dallas Mavericks have started a ticketing NFT scheme similar to the NFL's, but it applies to all home games throughout the season rather than just a few.  


In Europe, the Spanish soccer league La Liga has signed many agreements, including one for NFT collectibles with Sorare and moments with Dapper Labs. In the meanwhile, the NFT platform SportsIcon debuted documentary-style memorabilia. Real Madrid issued smart tickets as NFTs on the Flow blockchain, while Sorare sold a Cristiano Ronaldo collectible at Bonhams.  


As you can see, a lot has changed since the inception of NFTs, but this is my favorite change of all because these tickets would give us so many benefits. We spent a lot of money on tickets before and didn't get anything, but with these tickets, we really have benefits, all these advantages come to my mind,  can't wait!

Modex did an excellent job of providing enterprises and large projects with security and data protection. I read some really nice articles about it on their website and became even more captivated with blockchain technology.  


Blockchain, according to technologists, will someday replace usernames and passwords by providing us all with unique, encrypted digital identities that we can use to handle anything from internet information to our personal medical data.

It amuses me how blockchain will track and store all of our personal data, and because of its immutability, that data will remain safe and secure. In theory, it is how blockchain-based personal privacy protection may appear. Are you willing to accept it?
