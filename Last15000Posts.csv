2022-03-04 22:31:43�t6urum�1 YEAR CHALLENGE: from 0,36 ETH to 10 ETH�   Hi guys, so basically what the title says. After analysing a lot of trading strategies I found one which could be pretty profitable (at least on paper). I started out on January 18th with 0,36 ETH and after 659 ETH options traded I am now at 1,2 ETH. I think I can reach 10 ETH by the end of the year.  What do you guys think? Is it possible?  By the way I created a sub where you can follow this challenge and ask all the questions you want about crypto options and trading: [r/CryptoOptionsTrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoOptionsTrading/)  Until next post.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/xl54tct71gl81.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=8879381757c6cfa14a85323505e9083e8f139561�1�0

2022-03-04 06:29:55�t6cm74�Web3 take over is not limited to artists alone! It will save the whole creative industry�The past few months has seen talks about how web3 is coming to save artists who have been under oppression from third party managers. But what we don’t mention is that Web3 is coming to save the entire creative society. Be it an artist who sells art online, a musician, a photographer, an illustrator, story teller, literally anyone in the creative industry will benefit from web3.  I read this [article](https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/151603/web3-represents-massive-opportunity-content-creators) on the massive opportunities that lie within Web3. It talks about a crypto project called Envision that was born by creatives who are in the film and design space. People who have faced oppression from web2 first hand. Such projects will make sure creatives get value for their work and more.   Now back to my argument. I feel that web3 is not only limited to benefit creatives alone.   Which other industries do you guys think will also benefit from what Web3 promises?  Any projects out there we should be looking at?�138�0

Decentralization allows everyone to be equal and not one person in control of your money.  The Russian Ruble is down 40% this week!

The same thing has happened to numerous countries - Venezuela, Turkey etc.  Greed and Power is never a good combination.�5�0

2022-03-05 09:52:26�t767j6�Don't be surprised if ETH takes over as the dominant digital store of value�Wall Street investment bank analysts reaffirmed their bullish stance on the second-largest crypto asset and stated that [Ethereum](https://swapzone.io/currencies/ethereum?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) currently looks like the digital asset with the highest real use potential. [Bitcoin](https://swapzone.io/currencies/bitcoin?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) has a stronger brand, however, the first cryptocurrency lacks some of the technical features that Ethereum owns. Ether's real use cases give it the potential to become the dominant digital store of value in the coming years.   However, Goldman Sachs tend to believe that none of the crypto assets can compare with gold as a store of value: “We see gold as a defensive inflation hedge and crypto as a risk-adjusted inflation hedge.”  https://preview.redd.it/uvjkdc5uejl81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cdc2d5c5871e1fba8bfb5fb1e217ff9f407060f�4�0

2022-03-05 08:56:49�t75gi8�Crypto trading bots are making billions from 'sandwich trading'�"Cryptocurrency bots are using “sandwich tranding” to make huge profits in the Ethereum ecosystem.  ""Sandwich trading"" is a process in which software developers program a bot to spot another trader trying to buy a crypto asset on the blockchain. The robot places an order for the same token and completes the transaction first, driving the price of the asset up. The bot then ""finishes the sandwich"" by selling the token to the original trader at a higher price.  According to Bloomberg, the method was discovered by developers as a success. It was increasingly difficult to execute due to the number of other bots attempting ""sandwich trades."" The end result is the proliferation of “sandwich trading” bots to other blockchains, notably Solana, Polygon, and Avalanche. The bots brought sudden, exponential traffic growth to these altcoins. This caused their network to become congested.  Source:[https://youtu.be/72Ru3AF\_A5A](https://youtu.be/72Ru3AF_A5A)"�17�0

2022-03-06 23:39:47�t8bo42�6 Red Flags to Avoid When Investing in NFT-s�# TOP 6 Major Red Flags in NFT Projects  **When you enter the NFT market as a newcomer, you will most likely encounter many NFT projects that sound almost too good to be true. It does not matter whether you have close to zero or years of experience, people still tend to ignore these easy to remember red flags to separate promising NFT projects from the shady ones. To ensure that you don’t make these massive mistakes by getting into a suspicious NFT project, we gathered TOP 6 red flags to not ignore by any means.**     You can watch a 3 minute video instead: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99EJu\_7GAQ&t=58s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99EJu_7GAQ&t=58s)  # 1. Undoxxed team  **If you look at the project’s website and it does not have links to real Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn accounts, do not buy the NFT to prevent the possibility of getting scammed.**  **A doxed team, regardless of skillset or background, adds a layer of trust that there are real people building real projects.**  **Recommendation: Question their discord as to why there is no personal information included. If they cannot provide an answer as to why that satisfies your standards, stay away.**  # 2. Fake Twitter or Discord followers/accounts  **There are plenty of sources that will chat on behalf of the team on their Discord server. For example, Fiverr provides a message every min per hour just for $20. Different websites such as GetViral sell Twitter followers for almost no money that will create an illusion of a reliable following.**  **Recommendation: Do a quick audit, for instance use TwitterAudit. Look through engagement on posts to see if there are any real people or just bots. If the account has 120k followers and only 50 likes, it is a red flag. Also check if any notable people follow the account.**  # 3. Artificial hype  **Most shady NFT projects often purchase celebrity endorsements to generate unrealistic publicity around the project. Big names in the field of entertainment such as Thiago Silva can be hired for a silly amount of money to gain people’s attention in the sketchy project.**  **Recommendation: It is highly recommended to do some research. Dig into whether the partnerships are officially approved or just paid “partnerships”.**  # 4. Unrealistic mint price  **Hype-based pricing is certainly a real problem in the NFT space. The golden rule to identify a suspicious NFT project is to analyse the mint price. Behind a high mint price there is almost always the combination of hype and FOMO which drives the price unrealistically high. Many projects have nothing of substance to back their price and rely solely on “influencers” to boost the price. This results in investing money into those projects because of FOMO and losing everything when the hype dies.**  **Real community builders start the mint price at a reasonable level and do not extract all the liquidity out of the market. Just because the NFT project can demand a high price does not mean they should.**  **Recommendation: A project that allows the original minters to participate in an affordable way is what builds loyal supporters of the project to stick through the storm and lulls. As an opposite, projects that mint at ridiculously high prices often have difficulty finding support during tough times. Therefore, it is important to invest in projects you truly believe in.**  # 5. Predatory tactics  **Floor sweeps: Sweeping the floor in the NFT world means when a specific project buys all its minted NFTS at the floor price. The floor price is the minimum “ask” or the lowest price an NFT can be sold on the secondary market. It is the most popular metric for tracking a project’s performance over time and its relative success compared to others. As an emerging project, floor sweeping can be a method to attract newcomers by guaranteeing low entry points.**  **Banning members: Another predatory tactic to look out for is banning members for listing below prices. This means a member of the project is being kicked out of the community for selling their NFT at a much lower price than the fishy owners of the projects approve.**  **Echo chamber: A big red flag is the existence of an echo chamber. It is an environment where a person only encounters information or opinions that reflect and reinforce their own. This may limit the information the users consume and promote ideas relevant to the NFT project.**  **Recommendation: Step out of the chamber (Discord, forums etc) for a few days. This often allows for the head to clear so better judgement can be made.**  **Other popular red flags to watch out for are harassments of any kind, threats and piggybacking of popular projects.**  # 6. Meta cliché  **If the project fails to bring more than little innovation by introducing repetitive meta or roadmaps, be cautious. This can be an alarming indicator that the project is most likely going to take advantage of your money to cover its own interests. In addition, if the project fails to address legality concerns over securities and insurance of tokens, consider exiting the project.**  **Meta is easy to copy, and tokens can be launched only in a matter or hours. On the contrary, real economies take months or years to create.**  **The lack of ability to create proper Tokenomics or P2E for sustainability and longevity is also a worrying measure. For instance, the owners of the Bored Ape Yacht Club can participate in exclusive clubs and areas of the BAYC. This is a good way of thinking in the future and gaining people’s trust.**  **Tokenomics: The goal of a Tokenomic analysis is to understand the potential value of the project by considering all aspects of a token’s creation and management, including its supply, allocation, and distribution. The reason why Tokenomics is so important is that it helps to ascertain the future worth of an asset by giving an insight into the profitability of one asset over the other in the future.**  **P2E (Play to Earn): indicates a type of gaming that hinges on NFT technologies. For example, gamers can play video games and virtual worlds for rewards by making an initial investment in the NFT.**  **Identifying these red flags may be a long arduous journey of separating the real NFT projects from the quick cash-grabs, but once you understand the importance of it, success is guaranteed. Unfortunately, there are no blueprints to follow in this new industry, which means there are no right or wrong ways to approach a project.**  **Start by looking for niches and teams with the ability to execute. Find out who is the founding team, and how they work, what their values and grand vision are. If they show lack in respect, transparency, or communication, consider moving on.**6 Red Flags to Avoid When Investing in NFT-s�62�0

Transactions would be all encrypted and anonymous, validating your personal info in the app and it gives to you an anonymous user. The company has a warehouse where all the packages and articles arrive, and the same company send it to the buyer, so there’s no problem with the address and personal information of the buyers. Platform keeps with 8% of the price of everything. Bids in all products are allowed.  What do you think ? Would it work ? What would you change or do different ? 🤔�3�0

2022-03-07 20:29:18�t8yn1r�When are we going to see real adoption?�I have been in crypto since 2017, when eth was at 200 and btc at 4000 usd, so I'm aware of the trends of the market,  this has been a huge bear market BTW...   Btc has been around since 2008, and we are still waiting for some actual real world use, new coins come and go promising a lot, but in reality years keep passing by and crypto doesn't do anything useful at all, we literally just buy it waiting for someone that is willing to pay more for our coins one day or staking them to get more coins , that's literally all.  I'm a huge crypto believer,  but I'm starting to loose faith in this market, time goes by and crypto doesn't do anything it doesn't go anywhere.  I'm invested ( I'm speculating ) just the money that I can loose so I won't get really affected if this goes to 0 one day, I'm not worried about my money, I'm worried about this market not moving forward... what are you guys looking forward in the future of the crpyto markets?�4�0

If you have any opinions, please give a reason for them. I really appreciate any feedback. I also am about to put more money i with this most recent dip and will finally have my first eth. My plan is to hold long term on all of these at the moment as i’m currently under 18 so have a lot of time before i’ll need it. I’ll also be dca throughout the rest of the summer as i’ll have a job. My main information source is coin bureau, and i am somewhat following their portfolio. Millionaire by 30 is the goal!�0�0

2022-03-07 03:10:27�t8fn4f�De-FI Base - Dapps - Coinbase Wallet Dapps Scam�"Hello,  I just want to post this scam here and spread the word so other people will not fall into this scam again. And hopefully, someone can do something to take down their site and their platform.  I have been scammed by this Mining Pool Dapp called: DEFI-BASE. BE AWARE - PLEASE DO NOT TRUST ANY Dapps and use the Token Allowance Checker to set the spend allowance to $0  after you joined a Dapp. Doing this, the person who owns the Dapp can't transfer or take your cryptocurrency away.  You should do that before you transfer any cryptocurrency into the wallet. Or you should check it out if you are using one of the Dapps in the Coinbase market.  I am stupid enough that fell into this trap. I have lost about $100K on this FK Dapp. I have learned my lesson and I hope this will raise attention to everyone that are investing in the Cryptocurrency market. This Dapp is still running and hopefully, someone out there can find a way to stop them. Here is their fake website: [https://defi-base.com/](https://defi-base.com/)  Also, I think their customer support is probably a one-man show. He controls everything. So do not trust anything he said. I have attached some screenshots of the chatting with the "" customer support.""  To access the Dapp, you will need to enter the above website in your Coinbase wallet extension tap."�7�0

And these people don't deserve their crypto accounts to be frozen.  I know they are ''Centralized'' exchanges and they can do whatever they want. But this is not Satoshi created crypto for.

We can notice that from 2020 the supply started to exponentially increase as the government went to zero banking reserves (which I believe to be the true Ponzi scheme, if you are interested I may make a write up about this.), dropped interest rates, and as a consequence the cost of borrowing and the availability of financing was in the extreme and led to this high growth of the money supply.  https://preview.redd.it/uunokippn7m81.png?width=2128&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfeb2a3ab837ec8dabd36f12fc732c0b9874605f  Since the M2 is comprehensive on the circulating money, we can use this as a basis to compare certain assets against it, because theoretically with a higher money supply, more money gets deployed into the stock market. One Such example I wanted to particularly focus on was Gold and Bitcoin as they are both touted as the best stores of value. Ethereum with its new EIP1599 and upcoming triple halving is also beginning to look like sound money. Gold historically has done well and just because it has not moved and stands in a reaccumulation does not mean it may not experience a possible bull run.  **Figure 2A.** The Prices of Gold, Bitcoin, and ETH in USD - Not accounting for the growth in money supply but simply their price history. The numbers represent the local tops of each chart.  https://preview.redd.it/zxh975prn7m81.png?width=2125&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e239d8ce29a5817f9b2989bf2ea9f0c04aeea5  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/rh818a23o7m81.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=95fcc746ce9b38293555204a1605def72af3fd37  **Figure 2B**. The Prices of Gold, Bitcoin, and ETH in USD divided by M2 money supply. This is therefore accounting for the increase of money supply and measuring whether the asset can keep up with this inflation and erosion of purchasing power.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/4vdunis7o7m81.png?width=2141&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d86c00e846473307d396faf96195e5bd46414fd  https://preview.redd.it/8zjnov1bo7m81.png?width=2125&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b3605fd916e509470dab62fd3f91abb4a6ee9a1     As I said not particularly bearish for gold at the moment, but you may observe that while Bitcoin has been breaking and moving up continuously against the money supply, gold has not put in an all-time high since 1979. I personally think that both Gold and Bitcoin can co-exist, and I believe if we are to see an event of ""Stagflation"" which is when the economy is facing weak fiscal growth with surging unemployment in combination with a high inflation rate.  This was seen in 70 and 80s with stagflation and it is also when gold's real bull market began to fade as the economy grew and so did the money supply - gold did too but it just didn't keep up. I would suggest the people of this subreddit examine the data, diversify their portfolio and look into buying commodities in combination with digital assets and currencies.  Thank you for your time!"�1�0

2022-03-08 17:34:12�t9m5fh�Crypto Payments need YOUR help. The road to a New & Decentralized 'Paypal'�Amongst others, Binance has just announced their new payment gateway [Bifinity](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-launches-payments-technology-company-bifinity-421499824684903541?ref=83162597). I have the feeling every major centralized exchange/enity is throwing out the new 'paypal': Bitpay, Coinbase, Binance, [crypto.com](https://crypto.com?ref=83162597) and so on. Although this is great for adoption I would prefer the new Paypal to not be a centralized organization, this is also not in the spirit of crypto in general.  There are many alternatives on the blockchain, although still relatively small.  DYOR, but I mentioned three below that I know of. If you know another, leave it in the comments\*.  * [SolanaPay](https://solanapay.com?ref=83162597)  1. Mcap: 24.2 billion (Mcap of the SOL token) ([coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/nl/currencies/solana)) 2. Could not find whether fees are shared with holders\* 3. On the Solana network 4. works with any Solana-compatible token  &#x200B;  * [fcfpay.com](https://merchant.fcfpay.com/register?ref=83162597) (website of the payment gateway) & [frenchconnection.finance](https://affiliates.frenchconnection.finance?RefID=7F0SsL) (website of the token)  1. Mcap: 12.4 million ([coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/french-connection-finance)) 2. 66% of all transaction fees are given to the holder in dividends and burn (50/50 ratio) 3. On the BSC network. Will work on their own blockchain in the future. 4. Supports all crypto tokens  &#x200B;  * [alchemypay.org](https://alchemypay.org?ref=83162597)  1. Mcap: 169 million ([coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/alchemy-pay/)) 2. Could not find whether fees are shared with holders\* 3. On the ethereum network 4. Could not find which crypto tokens are supported\*  &#x200B;  So please when you have a webshop and want to start accepting crypto, FIRST look at one of these options and do not start running to one of the 'big guys'.  \*^(If you have any input in the missing information or extra statistics to include, let me know, I will try to keep this post updated.)�1�0

Sounds like it could be big.....  I feel like the biggest obstacle to mainstream and institutional adoption of DeFi & wider blockchain use cases is the absence of like an “on-ramp” and reading about Defactor and its Springpad program I’m thinking maybe this it is. They describe themselves as a bridge between traditional industries and the opportunity of decentralised finance, which is of itself pretty huge. You can read more about it in this announcement on Yahoo News [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defactor-awarded-algorand-foundation-grant-145500047.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defactor-awarded-algorand-foundation-grant-145500047.html)   “Defactor has been awarded a grant to develop a suite of decentralized finance (Defi) products on Algorand including a Defactor Algorand NFT Collateral Engine, Liquidity, and Staking pools.” What do you think??? Could be an absolute game-changer right?   Sounds like they’ve had some decent success already around running hackathons and creating a way for an Irish Whiskey Distillery (Gortinore Distillery & Co - there’s a case study you can read) to access the liquidity of their inaccessible asset by tokenising the barrels. Awesome stuff, just think about the opportunities.   Check out their website for more info [https://defactor.com/](https://defactor.com/)�1�0

Why give up now?  &#x200B;  Why did you invest in crypto in the first place? Probably hopping into the bandwagon, FOMO, or the most logical reason: to make money, aka you’re poor.  The market has been in the red for a few months. A few of my friends actually sold, it was the money they can afford to lose and wasn’t even their emergency fund. They told me that crypto is disappointing, they rather go for stable investments like index funds.  I on the other side have 80% of my net worth invested in crypto, only BTC and ETH tho. Those are the money that I kinda can’t afford to lose, but it's not the end of the world even I lose like 50% of them ( I have an emergency fund ready ).  To be honest, the first few months when I started crypto were awful. A small 10% dump would make me go crazy and a 3% pump would calm me down. Today, I’m too numb to feel anything and too dumb to do anything. I’m basically a robot, DCA on time, and refrain from watching the charts too often.  I can’t help to think in 3-5 years when I harvest all the profits, I would be able to give my family a better life, not as they needed it tho, it's just me who wanted to repay them. And also buy all the shits I want, and ignore the food price when I’m eating in the restaurant. The best scenario would be financial freedom, but that’s gonna be difficult to achieve.  Remember, investing in good projects is like planting a seed. DCA is like giving them constant care. When it rips, that’s the day you harvest that sweet success, aka tons of profit.  &#x200B;  Credits to CryptoCurrency�4�0

GLTA!!!�3/4/22: Marcel Kasumovich, One River Digital, Head of Research  Ethereum is the obvious candidate to play the role of digital bond. The Merge of the current Mainnet to the Beacon chain has entered its final stages with the Kiln testnet to go live soon. After further upgrades are finalized, staked ether collateral will be liquid. Opposite of bitcoin, ether is trading at a steep discount to its intrinsic value as a perpetual bond, which ranges from 5,500 to 7,600 versus the US dollar the latest Coinbase estimates. The conclusion is the same – there are other factors driving demand and prices.�19�0

2022-03-09 22:59:34�tak2lw�[Donut Initiative] Set Up Off-Chain Snapshot Voting�"# Objective  Recently, we passed a [governance poll to move DAO governance to an off-chain ""snapshot"" based governance client](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/ret29v/governance_poll_move_rethtrader_governance_to_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This change will allow more users to vote by incorporating all Donuts held in registered addresses and our staking contracts on both Ethereum mainnet and Gnosis (formerly xDai) chain, in liquidity pools on both Honeyswap and Uniswap, and previously unclaimed Contrib (see above poll link for additional details) and move the governance poll interface to [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/).   This proposal is to allocate developer funds to actually make this happen.  # Outline / Tasks  * Create a snapshot strategy that fits our governance protocol `min(CONTRIB, DONUT)` and includes:    * Donuts held at registered addresses on Ethereum Mainnet and Gnosis (formerly xDai) chain    * Donuts locked in our Ethereum mainnet and Gnosis (formerly xDai) chain staking contracts    * Donuts in our Uniswap (DONUT/ETH) and Honeyswap (DONUT/XDAI) liquidity pools    * Previously unclaimed Contrib (point snapshot strategy to new contrib contract on Gnosis) * Create a new CONTRIB token contract on Gnosis chain * Airdrop previously earned CONTRIB tokens to all users on Gnosis chain. *Note, CONTRIB tokens are soulbound, non-transferable tokens with no monetary value. They act as on-chain proof of* r/Ethtrader *contribution for a specific registered address.* * Update the distribution scripts and instructions to have the multisig mint and issue future earned CONTRIB tokens on Gnosis chain.  * Create instructions for how to make new governance proposals on snapshot.  * Perform testing   # Reward  75k $DONUT and 25k $CONTRIB to be shared based on contributor time spent. This reward is to be provided from the [r/EthTrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthTrader/) treasury/community fund, to be approved by the Multisig.  # Closing  Donut Initiatives are a way encourage people to propose and steward new initiatives that will enhance the EthTrader community experience. See the [Donut Initiative Guidelines](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/donuts/initiative_guidelines) for more information about the intent and process for proposing new initiatives. Feedback is welcome in the [Governance Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/ogugf9/governance_discussion/) or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/YneSucMH).  All input is welcome!"�4�0

2022-03-09 13:57:50�ta8c36�Looking to hear opinions from some other degen ERC-20 token traders.�So like many on this sub I have been bullish on Ethereum for a while and have been DCA for a some time and accumulating a nice holding. I think that Ethereum has staying power and it’s utility in the crypto space will continue to grow and thrive.  I will continue to accumulate and grow my holding and think that investments in crypto outweigh money sitting in a bank collecting a small interest rate.  However I do have some funds I would like to use to invest in more risky low cap type ERC-20 projects. I know it’s a complete risk but I have that degen trader itch and would love to find a project that is low cap and has that hockey stick upswing potential.  I’m sure it’s not the popular trading opinion of the sub however I know there has to be other degen traders that have that need to gamble a bit with the markets when they have extra funds and would love to hear some opinions on some tokens that fit the criteria.  I currently got into one project that has this potential called Jacy token. (super low market cap and a growing community… also have an app and NFT project in development to be released soon)  However I want to spread out my investment over a few of these tokens and would love to hear some other peoples thoughts.�1�0

2022-03-09 12:09:53�ta6fra�You can pretty much use any old computer as a hardware wallet using MEW offline transactions.�So MEW (myetherwallet) supports something called offline transactions, basically you need two computers one is connected to the internet and the other is offline.  Step1: you go the the MEW website on the online computer and enter the details of the transaction you want to make then you put them on a flash drive.  Step2: you plug the flash drive into the offline computer and sign the transaction offline using your private key (this is exactly what a hardware wallet does)  Step3: unplug the flash drive and plug it back into the online computer and submit the transaction.  You have successfully made a transaction offline with zero risk of malware potentially stealing your private key, the offline computer here is functioning exactly like a hardware wallet would signing transactions offline, a hardware wallet also stores the private key in an encrypted form too but you can just install a password manager on your offline computer to achieve the same function.  Here's the official guide if you want to try it: https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/5380599-making-an-offline-transaction  Hardware wallet companies hate this simple trick lol, the only real benefit of the hardware wallet is that it's much smaller than even the smallest computers like a raspberry pi and it has a TPM which allows you to securely encrypt the private key using just an 8 digit PIN.  Have any other wallets implemented this feature other than MEW? I don't think MEW supports offline transactions on mobile, I think using a phone as a hardware wallet would be more convenient than a PC.�7�0

2022-03-10 15:24:14�tb12j4�Yield farming and Liquid staking strategy?�I want to share a new DeFi strategy that I just test it.  I staked ETH, but you can also do it with DOT, SOL, BNB, and MATIC.  So let's start.  First, we should stake our ETH. I staked it on a liquid staking protocol like StaFi for 6% APR (You can find other liquid staking platforms with different APR).   After staking, I will get a new token (rETH) with a 1:\~1 ratio. Then I can trade rETH with USDC on Uniswap while earning interest on my main ETH.  So far, I have USDC and my staked ETH.  The second move is staking my stable coin. Anchor is good for stable staking with 19,5% APY on UST. APY is stable, and you only need to be careful of a potential bank run if the reserve runs out of funds and APY drops to 13%.  For exchanging your USDC to UST, you can use Binance (Centralized) or Terra bridge (Decentralized).  You should repeat these steps vice versa if you want to unstake your main ETH.  Any thought about this strategy?�12�0

There are smart people out there who are creating on-ramps to crypto, and it isn’t just protestors who need ways to not have their funds seized…   The obstacle to mainstream adoption has remained the same throughout the journey we’ve been on since crypto first became a thing: accessibility. Turns out these Defactor guys aren’t just helping out with that, they’re securing grants from Algorand and running an incubator called Springpad! We love to see it.  If they can not only bring old-school industries like Whiskey Distillery up to date and into the future, imagine the potential possibilities once other more progressive use cases start to get involved, this could be absolutely mammoth - i’m going to be keeping a close eye on this… I just love how positive it is.

With the market’s recent volatility and the impending geopolitical uncertainty, experts advise investors to stick to their long-term investment strategies and avoid knee-jerk reactions to the market’s changes. They also strongly recommended putting a long-term strategy into place if there is not one in place already.�0�0

2022-03-10 00:33:47�tam0sn�"Head of the SEC - Gary Gensler - recently reported that 90-95% of all retail stock orders are routed through ""dark pools"" - which exacerbate and encourage fraud. Blockchains can help drastically limit and restrict such potentials through transparency, immutability, traceability, and more."�"The interview was a little over a month ago now on Bloomberg TV.   You want to know why the middle-class is getting demolished? Well, here's one reason wrapped in millions of other reasons. You want to know why it's so difficult to get ahead and make a living-wage, let alone a comfortable wage? Here's one reason wrapped in millions of other reasons.   The relevant quote is,   >*""... if you place a market order, retail market order... 90, 95% do not go to the lit exchanges, do not go to NASDAQ or NYSE. They go to wholesalers. They don't have order-by-order competition. And part of that is because of what you just said... Payment-for-Order-Flow, which yes, it is banned in the U.K., in Canada, in Australia, the European Union... a lot of our market right now is dark. It's not in the lit markets, David.""*  It's not so much a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma, no... it's more like a slap in the face, wrapped in a kick in the groin, inside a stab in the back.    The implications are gargantuan. It's somehow both surprising and not surprising that this isn't in the news and being talked about more. From what I've seen it's pretty hush-hush with very little coverage.   You can see and listen to Mr. Gensler [here](https://youtu.be/NBkPQ0VsWV0?t=226) on Bloomberg TV. The quote above is at about the 3:46 mark and the video begins there. The full interview is a little over 10 minutes, fwiw.     I mean... <smh> Holy freaking mooing cow. This should be ringing alarm bells from New York to London to Paris to Berlin to Istanbul to Beijing to Hong Kong to Tokyo, back around to San Francisco to Denver to Kansas City to Nan-*fucking*-tucket.     These are the sorts of things that Distributed Ledger Technology (aka ""blockchain tech;"" blockchains are just one type of DLT) can help. This is the sort of thing people have been talking about when it comes to benefits of DLTs and how they can help limit and restrict fraud and abuse and criminality.  Blockchain technology can improve services - the stock market in this case - in a manner that is decentralized, tamper-proof, transparent, traceable, reliable, trustful, and secure.   I just now came across [this](https://www.disruptordaily.com/blockchain-use-cases-stock-trading/) article while writing this and think it does a good job on explaining (better than I can do at the moment) in further depth how DLT/blockchain can make for a more fair and equitable market."�25�0

2022-03-11 15:35:36�tbspjs�Did “Snow Crash” and “Ready Player One” just predict the future of advertisement? What are you doing to be a part of it?�If you have read Snow Crash by Neal Stevenson or watched Ready Player One, then I guess you already have a glimpse of how the metaverse will look like. Released in 1992 (ideally the year that birthed the metaverse), Snow Crash predicts a futuristic world filled with neon commercials advertisements. In Ready Player One, Nolan Sorrento narrates on pure O2 which is ofcourse in a virtual world will help them make money the moment a player logs into that verse.   Fastforward, this I believe is now what we know as the Metaverse.   You know they say numbers never lie. A quick read [here](https://www.metagaming.com/2022/02/25/snow-crashs-metaverse-was-filled-with-ads-in-1992-and-the-real-one-will-be-too/), you will see how many companies are actually joining the Metaverse. For instance we all know Facebook now Meta makes a fortune off advertisement, and the fact that they have gambled so high on this new reality shows us how much Zuck believes that Metaverse advertisement is the future. JP Morgan, Gucci, Roblox, Microsoft and many more are also invested here.   The Metaverse is coming big and advertisements here will be BIGGER. So, my question is what can we do to benefit from this coming change?�132�0

2022-03-11 13:46:59�tbqhi9�This is how ETH will connect you to your favorite artists & change the Music Industry (Music NFT)�Everyone is so focused on Music NFTs being ownership tokens, but the real value will be in utility and direct connection to the artist. This is nothing new for Music. Let me give a example:  let's say you buy a limited edition signed vinyl. it comes with a front row ticket to the show, a meet n greet, and a tshirt. you go to the signing...you get to meet the artist and get your collectible vinyl! it's great, even to say a few words to this artist. you really enjoy their music, you just want to say thank you.  its a great experience. you carefully take it home your signed collectible vinyl and make sure its in perfect condition.  the show sold out, now the ticket that came with the vinyl is worth $200!  You sell it to someone from work because you can't make it. It's an hour away anyway. You're glad you could make it to the signing tho.  ***Now its 10 years later.*** Your concert days are more limited now, but you still love the music. You find that old tshirt, still in perfect condition in the back of your closet. Its worth $250 on StockX. Wow!  Next, you think about your prized vinyl. Signed and still in mint condition. You see that the signed collectible vinyl is worth $1000 on eBay. Wow! You think to yourself about how funny that is. You listen to the music on Spotify or watch on Youtube every once in a while. For the most part, the vinyl has been gathering dust in your collection. But thats okay, it's like an old trophy to you. Maybe you'll frame it one day. You decide to hang on to it. You love having it, and plus if its worth $1000 now...imagine another 10 years later?  Did any part of this have to do with owning this music?  Did you ever think you owned the music?  Music NFT is just like these products. The Music NFT itself is like a digital vinyl with a lifetime access ticket to irl and virtual events/shows/community. Also, **Music NFTs deliver the same products listed above.** Its a way to go directly to fans and let them pay in crypto. It's a new way to deliver a product package. It doesn't have to be an ownership token to create huge value.�0�0

2022-03-12 17:59:13�tcmzxw�10M Ether Now Locked on Eth 2.0 Staking Contract. The landmark figure represents over $26 billion worth of the asset at current prices. I have decided to HODL for up to 10 years to 200+ ETH!!! GLTA!!!�Over 10 million ether (ETH) is now locked on Ethereum’s Eth 2.0 staking contract ahead of a planned upgrade to a proof-of-stake blockchain, data from analytics tool Dune Analytics show.  The landmark figure was reached nearly 15 months after Eth 2.0 staking went live in November 2020 following a consensus vote.  Eth 2.0 is the Ethereum network’s multi-stage shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which validates transactions using nodes run by “stakers.” This is in favor of the current proof-of-work design, which relies on centralized entities called “miners” for validating transactions on the network.  The current design has resulted in a slow and expensive network, with fees reaching exorbitant prices of $250 and above, during periods of congestion.  The Eth 2.0 deposit contract initially required 524,000 ether to launch but was oversubscribed by over 400% in the days closer to the launch after a slow start.  The data shows that 67,040 unique depositors have contributed to the staking contract. The contributed ether is locked and inaccessible but stakers are earning 4.81% in annual yields, data from Staking Rewards show.  This month saw a spike of ether deposits to the Eth 2.0 contracts after a relatively lean period in January and February this year, charts show.  &#x200B;  [ Eth 2.0 deposits saw a spike this month. \(Dune Analytics\) ](https://preview.redd.it/tenvo0msqzm81.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1491c4deed97f3e50c4e6dc0a117994739d294f)  Eth 2.0 is currently in the so-called ‘Kintsugi’ testnet stage before rollout. Testnets run atop and mimic the activity of the core blockchain, or mainnet, without affecting it. They allow developers and the community to test applications and features in a controlled setting.  Ether saw nominal gains of 2.9% in the past 24 hours as the broader crypto market remained flat. The crypto was trading at $2,620 at the time of writing, as per data from CoinGecko.  &#x200B;  [I bought 3.05 ETH today and then staked all at 4.5&#37; APR in ETH2 rewards.

2022-03-12 08:05:23�tcbnp9�Thoughts on my defi progess so far?�" I'm still very new to this world so I'm open to any thoughts, critics, or suggestions on my learning progress thus far, as I'm sure I still have some underlying misconceptions about crypto and defi. I live in the US and am in favor of both decentralization and centralization when appropriate.  I don't have a lot of money and defiantly don't have enough invested to worry about capital gain/loss taxes but nevertheless I am very conservative with my stable coins. I want to see them (at least USDC, DAI, and UST) given more attention by the fed before I stake my savings into it but at the same time I view them as a way to minimize exposure to inflation. Because of this rationale I don't really trust platforms like anchor or beefy that are offering ridiculous apy on their coins, and another main reason why I've left stable coins out of this list entirely is because from my personal audits gemini is the only platform I trust to handle lending my stable coins for me 100%.  I know there have to be some platforms that are truly making insane yields and are paying out investors fairly but it's so time consuming to audit how these cexs, dexs, and doas are making money that I've just had to make it a rule to stay away from anything that seems to good to be true. Even if the platform has lots of liquidity, money deposited, or staked I still don't trust it until I can see where the money is actually coming and going from. If you all have some insider info on how these super high apy deposit sites are holding their reserves, making these yields, and how they are distributed then feel free to share the supporting documents so we can openly audit them!  Also I'm pretty bent on maintaining full custody of my assets, hence the reason why I marked any LPs as no, they are not fully owned by the investor (myself), and why I include argent (stark/zk ftw). I understand that wrapping and staking coins removes some level of security and ownership so you're probably thinking ""why don't I trust pools?"" Well on one hand I'm somewhat confident in my understanding of the tech but on the other hand I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to understanding the market... I would like to earn some yield that is better than what you can earn depositing/lending/staking so it seems liquidity pools might be for me, but I can't keep up with the constant due diligence that seems to be required and permanent loss scares the shit out of me.  Also I mine btc so don't have to worry about fiat onboarding for btc, but for other tokens (eth, avax, matic, etc.) I'm planning on investing usd so any suggestions for some fait on-ramps would also be great as well! Lastly, that brings me to the actual process of transferring any coin into a yield bearing coin. Like I said I'm new here so these are just the onboarding process I've found so far, and to me most of them seem a little overbearing (too many steps + fees along the way) hence why I made this chart in the first place. So, if there are anyways to optimize the processes I've found or alternatives to them I would love to hear it! Really though any incite on the subject would be great to hear as I'm finding a lack of current/reliable information out there, and as fun as learning this on my own has been I think it's time to start having some conversations with the community!  I wrote it at 4am as a rough draft so I could get some opinions when I woke up, please forgive me. I know the post is all over the place so I apologize for the mess, but I'm planning on make a much clearer and more in depth post about everything I've found so far to help out anyone else who is just getting their feet in the water like me!  edited for those who had trouble reading my blob of a post ;)  https://preview.redd.it/v9i9c1rji0n81.png?width=1554&format=png&auto=webp&s=647e607d2ffddf2f18d195bccc2b953f9cc10f1b"�1�0

I just check the fees between binance (0.00625 ~ $16) and coinbase pro (0.001176 ~ $3). The problem is that coinbase pro doesn’t allow you to choose network, and even with the ERC20 address added it keeps on showing me 0.001176.  I really need to know if the transaction with coinbase pro will be a good choice or it will trash all my ETH.�4�0

2022-03-13 14:10:02�td7pfu�Here's How Much $100 In Ethereum Could Be Worth If Standard Chartered's $35,000 Price Prediction Comes True. GLTA!!!�"One of the largest banks in the world placed a bullish call on cryptocurrency Ethereum ETH in September 2021. Here’s a look at how much a small investment in the cryptocurrency could return if the price prediction is reached.  What Happened: Standard Chartered has been in business for over 160 years and operates financial services in over 59 countries. The company is publicly listed in London and Hong Kong and has 776 branches worldwide.  The banking giant, which is one of the top 100 listed companies on the London Stock Exchange, set a price target on Ethereum in September 2021.  Standard Chartered’s global research team placed a price prediction of $35,000 on Ethereum. The bank also said Bitcoin BTC could rise 3x from the levels at the time to a price in a range of $50,000 to $175,000.  While the bank said Ethereum had more risk than Bitcoin, it saw more use cases and a better long term opportunity for Ethereum.  A $100 Investment: Ethereum trades at $2,589.35 at the time of writing.  A $100 investment in the second largest cryptocurrency could purchase 0.0386 ETH. If the price of Ethereum hits $35,000 as predicted, the $100 investment would be wroth $1,351.  The $100 investment would return 1,251% from today’s price to the $35,000 price target from Standard Chartered.  &#x200B;  [From $0.00 to $346K+ ETH only portfolio. At one point, I was half way to becoming a \\""crypto-US millionaire.\\"" Long-term, like 5 to 10 years time, I will likely become one many times over!!! I'll continue to stack, stake and HODL ETH to richest!!!

It was the first community points system that is still alive!   Right now you can only use Donuts to be able to:  1.	Buy the banner of r/EthTrader to advertise something 2.	Tip content 3.	Buy the special membership (can only use the ethereum network, so not worth it)  4.	Governance power - There are barely any governance polls these days.    As a member of community we should try to make our sub better and help Donuts grow!   Let me know your ideas!�26�0

Then connect your wallet by clicking on the ""no wallet connected"" button and connect your wallet using one of the 4 options below (this guide will assume you are using Metamask but the steps should be similar for the other wallet options):  https://preview.redd.it/mjdatfubktn81.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=9274f33d6a4b8a60396907fd3ea28ad2d01e384f  Once your wallet is connected the address should replace the ""no wallet connected"" dialogue.  If the dialogue instead changes to ""Wrong Network"" then switch networks to Gnosis chain (Instructions [here](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup) on how to set this up if you haven't already).  The page should now look like this:  https://preview.redd.it/fnxmob0dktn81.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=f15c995e5e09b1ed810075c9cc410130c128a91e  Next click on the select a token box in the lower portion of the swap UI in the middle of the page and a list of tokens will pop up:  https://preview.redd.it/w2j34lvdktn81.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fea6f4fa81ab47e9ac26c0e13f24cd3838baab  [0x524B969793a64a602342d89BC2789D43a016B13A](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0x524B969793a64a602342d89BC2789D43a016B13A/token-transfers)  Now enter 300 in the box next to donuts and it will show you the cost in xDai:  https://preview.redd.it/s5j2x0sektn81.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=3769db837499b6f88dbeb9b4a6ea7f193ab40bc8  Click swap and sign the transaction and you are done.  https://preview.redd.it/hcky9rffktn81.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=032c86e02037ea20b8e3ffcd2187670998345f91  **Task 2 - Provide at least 300 DONUTS liquidity on Honeyswap**  For this task you need to head back to honeyswap again but this time to the pool page:  [https://app.honeyswap.org/#/pool](https://app.honeyswap.org/#/pool)  Which will look like this:  https://preview.redd.it/pgoabp9gktn81.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=28fb969105e68f41c667f2c43c15c067bd6bbbb0  Once again connect your wallet and ensure you are connected to Gnosis chain as outlined in task 1 above.

For this task you will need at least 0.02 GNO (or equal value of other assets) deposited in order to be able to borrow the required 0.01 GNO. **Bear in mind that once you have borrowed funds you need to ensure that you still have the required collateral in the event assets dip after you have borrowed, if the value of your collateral drops too low relative to the amount you have borrowed you can be liquidated and lose your collateral, if you have lent GNO or xDAI this won't be an issue.**  First head to the borrow page of Agave.Finance: [https://app.agave.finance/#/borrow](https://app.agave.finance/#/borrow)  Connect your wallet and ensure you are connected to Gnosis chain as outlined in task 3.

You need roughly 2x the amount you wish to borrow, deposited.  If you can borrow the required amount of 0.01 GNO then enter 0.01 into the amount box and click continue:  https://preview.redd.it/4w685qboktn81.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5a81fdad9ea45b95bbc83efaca62e12d80d121f  Lastly click the borrow button, sign the transaction and you have completed this task.  https://preview.redd.it/ur43nwkoktn81.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=41afd0eda74478423fc876b0865016bdf0e6f574"�6�0

2022-03-16 21:01:42�tft29h�How Crypton work�"Crypton exchange is an anonymous decentralized blockchain-based exchange, that is the brainchild of the global Utopia Ecosystem.   An anonymous platform for web surfing, transactions, file sharing, and communication. Crypton exchange is constantly updated with new cryptocurrency pairs, and today BTC and Monero are next in line.  &#x200B;  Crypton coin is the only currency that is used as a means of payment in the Utopia ecosystem. That is, Crypton is the currency of a free and secure Internet.  &#x200B;  At the same time, the distribution of Crypton is absolutely fair - all 100% of the coins are distributed among the miners, no ""allocation of tokens for the team”, ""privileges for early investors” and the like: all users engaged in the Crypton miners are on equal terms.

2022-03-17 20:36:17�tgjn4l�Utopia p2p ecosystem�"How Crypton work  Crypton exchange is an anonymous decentralized blockchain-based exchange, is the brainchild of the global Utopia Ecosystem.  An anonymous platform for web surfing, transactions, file sharing, and communication. Crypton exchange is constantly updated with new cryptocurrency pairs, and today BTC and Monero are next in line.    Crypton is the only currency that is used as a means of payment in the Utopia ecosystem. That is, Crypton is the currency of a free and secure Internet.  At the same time, the distribution of Crypton is absolutely fair - all 100% of the coins are distributed among the miners, no ""allocation of tokens for the team”, ""privileges for early investors” and the like: all users engaged in the Crypton miners are on equal terms. And Crypton mining does not require expensive equipment and a huge amount of electricity - just install Utopia Mining Bot and keep it online. The bot provides routing of data packets, for which a reward is awarded.  Transactions in Crypton within the Utopia ecosystem are processed instantly, and for the convenience of e-commerce, the coin is split up to 9 decimal places.   Only a fast, convenient and fair proprietary cryptocurrency can guarantee financial independence and, as a result, the stable operation of the free Internet ecosystem. And this is exactly what Crypton provides for Utopia.  Meanwhile, you can trade or buy Bitcoin and Monero anonymously on Crypton exchange https://crp.is/listing   More information on  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/utopia/  https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypton  https://t.me/utopiachatoff https://u.is/en/"�3�0

2022-03-17 08:27:17�tg5e8h�Bitcoin, as we all know, has a huge influence on the entire crypto asset class, including our prized ETH.�" Bitcoin has attempted numerous times to break through the ""Bull market support band,"" all of which have failed.  On the weekly time frame, this has resulted in a bear flag with a target of 20,000 USD.  We would be dumb not to at least prepare for this possibility, given the charts, the lengthy downtrend, and continual selling pressure.  I own ETH and am a long-term believer, but I also have cash on hand to take advantage of any price drops if this scenario plays out.   Bottom line: be prepared for anything."�2�0

2022-03-17 06:39:43�tg3wim�I believe that the concept of NFT tickets is way better than purchasing pricey jpegs.�I’ve read tons of posts on Reddit about NFTs and their prospective uses that sparked a lot of discussion. People are recognizing that NFTs are much more than apes, punks, and rocks. NFTs are being embraced by a growing number of brands and businesses, who are realizing their full potential.  As I got to know more about NFT ticketing, I came to realize that NFTs make a lot of sense as an NFT ticket since they aim to solve inefficiencies faced by traditional ticketing systems.  Many projects are aiming to start NFT Ticketing initiatives, and they are all at different stages of development. One of the most popular in the NFT ticketing world is the [GetProtocol](https://www.get-protocol.io/), a blockchain-based engine for issuance of fully digital proofs of a rights to enter events. GET is the utility token that serves as a fuel for smart tickets issued by the GET Protocol.Currently the protocol is used by two ticketing companies: GUTS Tickets (stadium shows to large-scale dance events) and Itix (theater-focused). And since I've always been a fan of music when it comes to NFT Ticketing Marketplace for Music I’d say [Centaurify](http://www.centaurify.com/?r=1) appears to be the clear frontrunner so far. It is built on the Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Cardano networks, and it can be used to mint and distribute thousands of NFTs at a low cost. Artists also have complete control over how tickets are used and resold. In addition, they provide a link between NFT merchandise and NFT ticketing. They also just started staking the CENT token and the next two years could be really huge for them.  NFTs have proven to be successful across a number of industries. From gaming to high-end luxury fashion, NFT use cases have demonstrated the importance of creating lasting connections between a company or a brand and its users/customers. NFTs could also be a way for the different industries to boost revenues that have been lost since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.�212�0

I predicted a sharp movement at the end of this month, which seems to be happening.  Now the question is, can ETH uphold this upwards trend or will it fall back again? What do you guys think? How do you feel about the market?

The only organic mega mega dump was 2014.    \- Inflation, equities weakness, looming land war and eventual invasion in Europe, commodities skyrocketing, etc. ONLY shook us to the late Jan and late Feb lows.

2022-03-18 11:32:54�tgz8yo�Coinbase Scam�After noticing that when I bought or converted any crypto on CB; the amount I ended up with was less than the transaction request. I decided to conduct an experiment and I’m going to share with everyone here.  I decided to experiment with a stable coin conversion of UST to Algo. The amount being $500 of UST to Algo at a market price of $0.73 per coin. The transaction said it deducted -498.256104 UST but took $500 worth. This also gave me 670.065421 ALGO (which comes out to $485.1477). Now Coinbase claims they don’t charge fees for conversions but then where did the delta go? 2% of the transaction is missing and deducted from my transaction of $500 UST to ALGO. This is deceiving and predatory business practices, be careful with CB they are crooks.�0�0

2022-03-18 08:55:38�tgwz2p�[Poll Proposal] implementation of a cap to the maximum karma earned each distribution�&#x200B;  The reason for this action is to implement a cap on the amount of karma one person can earn in a distribution, as it stands there is no limit on this at all. my proposal is we start out at 50K karma cap and then this can be worked on down the line if it needs to be tweaked. this current distribution would have the top persons karma halved but most others would not be affected so badly and it is only the top 5 who would be reduced mostly everyone else would have more. In the last few distributions the top person in first place would be affected but the majority of others had 50K or less karma so would have not be affected.   &#x200B;  Yes will be to implement a cap on Karma of 50K  No would be to leave it at no cap   This governance poll proposal will remain up for a minimum of 2 days per governance guidelines. This proposal requires sign off from 2 moderators to proceed to a full governance poll.�3�0

2022-03-19 20:31:37�ti44t8�Crypto.com introduces 'Spending Power' - you can borrow against your staked coins with 0% interest if repaid within seven days. If the loan is not repaid within seven days, the interest rate is 9.99% thereafter.� Yes, that's right. Apparently the new 'Spending Power' feature let's you take a crypto loan using your staked coins as collateral... with 0% interest if that loan is repaid within 7 days. This seems like a fairly original idea as you continue to earn interest on any coins in Earn while being allowed to use those same coins as collateral for the 'Spending Power' loan.  From what I've read, this new feature is already rolling out in Canada and the borrow limit is tied to card tier.  More importantly, this is a super convenient way to top up your CDC card immediately while waiting for fiat to be credited from your bank account to the CDC Fiat Wallet (and free due to that 7-day 0% interest period).  Loans which are not repaid within 7 days then accrue interest at 9.99%.  As someone who was massively critical when CDC decreased the Earn Limit recently, that does now start to make a little more sense. More importantly, this will hopefully inspire other lenders (Nexo, etc) to start offering similar interest free loans....

2022-03-19 17:04:05�thzno7�Ethereum Outflows From Exchanges Hit 2022 Peak as ETH Price Surges. Stack, Stake and HODL ETH to Richest!!! GLTA!!!�Large outflows from exchanges are considered a signal that traders aren't looking to sell, a potentially bullish sign for Ethereum.  &#x200B;  [ I'm currently long-term a total of 138.465+ ETH, 135+ ETH staked at 4.5&#37; APR in ETH 2.0 rewards, and HODL \(5 years minimum time horizon\) to richest!!! GLTA!!! ](https://preview.redd.it/cw68yp0jfdo81.jpg?width=1135&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86c448479c292f14e1e2c9caf61d7672d7823274)  More than $500 million worth of Ethereum was withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges earlier this week, as traders look to hold on to their crypto in anticipation of bullish price action.  This is according to data shared by IntoTheBlock, a crypto market research firm, which shows that 180,000 ETH was withdrawn from exchanges on Tuesday. This figure represents the highest aggregated exchange withdrawal of ETH since October, the firm tweeted. At the time, the outflow of ETH preceded a 15% price increase for the cryptocurrency within 10 days.   Likewise, ETH’s price has also been up following the recent massive outflow. Trading at approximately $2,500 on March 15, ETH has since surged to $2,934 at the time of writing.   That’s a 17% increase over the week, making Ethereum the only top 10 crypto by market cap to see double-digit percentage gains besides Avalanche (AVAX).  &#x200B;  [ To date, I've earned 3.28 ETH from staking. I'm projected to earn 5 more ETH by the end of this year, assuming the yield remains the same. However, after the merge, ETH staking yield is expected to increase to between 9 - 12&#37;. I'll continue to stack, stake and HODL ETH to richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/9sg9iaptfdo81.jpg?width=587&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f4a6eec14b827be9377c3ef9147f0a71ed5bfbe)  Data from Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform, appears to corroborate IntoTheBlock’s analysis. It estimates that up to 352,317 ETH could have left exchanges on the same day, though the firm provides a very wide range for its data set. It’s worth noting, however, that Chainalysis has not estimated an outflow this large in at least six months.  According to the firm, such outflows would be considered a bullish market indicator. “Assets held on exchanges increase if more market participants want to sell than to buy, and if buyers choose to store their assets on exchanges,” it wrote.   Of course, ETH’s gains in the context of the wider crypto market cannot be ignored. Every top 10 coin, besides Terra, has seen a price increase of at least 5% this week, particularly after the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday. Bitcoin, in particular, is up 8%. Bitcoin also saw a possible 39,000 BTC exchange outflow on Friday, amounting to about $1.6 billion.  IntoTheBlock also noted that about 190,000 ETH was deposited for staking using Lido, a service that lets users stake various assets on other chains, including Ethereum 2.0—the coming upgrade to Ethereum. The ETH 2.0 deposit contract now has over 10,000,000 ETH staked on it, amounting to over $27 billion in staked value.�0�0

2022-03-19 14:31:34�thweoe�Ethereum Staking Queue Nears All-Time High Ahead Of Mainnet Merge. ETH should return to USD$4,000+ very soon!!! GLTA!!!�Ethereum is well on its way to the Merge as more milestones are met. The move to proof-of-stake will no doubt be a game-changer for the blockchain. So as the day for the merge draws closer, users of the network have been upping their activity in recent times. One of the places where Ethereum has recorded an uptick has been the staking queue which is now nearing its previous all-time high.  Ethereum Staking Queue Crosses 300,000  The Ethereum staking queue is a good indicator of how users of the network are looking at it. When this is low, investors may be more wary and not want to stake their coins on the network. However, when this number begins to go up, it signals a number of things for Ethereum, among them, being that users are looking more positively at it.  This queue has been going up in recent times and as of 17th March, has almost reached its previous high. It had previously touched a new high above 330K in June of 2021 when the bull rally had been in full bloom. But the subsequent market downtrend had seen this number come down with it going into the bear trend. Only to begin another recovery in August of the same year.  As for 2022, the number had been steadily growing but hadn’t seen any significant boost. This boost came about two weeks into March when the number of wallets on the queue crossed 300K. It is the sharpest increase ever recorded by the Balance Validators Status.  What Does This Mean?  For a network like Ethereum, beating and setting new records aren’t a new thing. But like with any other thing, such high interest will definitely have an impact on the network and the price. In this case, the number of wallets that are now suitable to stake on the network is higher and are waiting to be activated to do so. When such a large amount of wallets are given the green light to start staking, it will take a **good chunk of coins out of current circulation**.  This is because it takes 32 ETH for a wallet to be eligible to become a validator on the network. This means that when these wallets on the queue are activated, about 1 million ETH coins will be locked away for at least three months, which is the minimum staking duration for Ethereum.  A look at past charts shows that times like this have coincided with the increase in price for ETH. However, there has been one deviation which was during the November rally where ETH hit a new high above $4,000.  Nevertheless, with such volumes of ETH being temporarily taken out of circulation, it most likely will positively affect the value of the cryptocurrency, pushing the value towards previous highs.  &#x200B;  [To date, I've earned 3.28 ETH from staking. I'm projected to earn about 5 more ETH by the end of this year, assuming the yield is at 4.5&#37; APR. After the merge, ETH staking yield is expected to increase to between 9 - 12&#37;.

2022-03-19 13:37:43�thvdec�ETH options trading?�Is there anyone interested in buying or selling put or call options on their ETH?  Our team has developed a protocol for writing insurance contracts on public blockchains. One of the things you can use this for is writing put or call options for cryptocurrencies, and we're interested in talking with ETH hodlers to see whether you guys want us to develop specific interactive products for the Ethereum community.  NOTE: We are not selling anything. We are not promoting any NFTs or tokens or shilling any project. We are also not collecting wallet addresses. We're just interested in developing useful tools for crypto users. We think one of the biggest problems with Ethereum is its volatility, and derivatives, like options, allow people to hold more ETH at a lower cost-basis. It will also, over time, allow the price of ETH to become more predictable, which will then allow ETH to be used for more things. Well, at least, that's what we think. The point of this post is to gauge interest from Ethereum's community of active traders, to see if they want innovation to go in this direction.  Our project: https://www.blockchainsure.com�1�0

2022-03-20 17:27:39�tiq438�The 5 Best Crypto Interest Accounts for 2022�Crypto interest accounts enable you to stake your coins for a period to earn interest which is similar to traditional savings accounts. This form of investment is becoming more popular as crypto interest rates help to overcome inflation.  Note: These crypto interest accounts are in no particular order of preference.   * **Cryptocom - Choose from 40+ cryptos & stablecoins**  [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) has made a big push to become one of the leading crypto compound interest platforms around the world. This platform now offers interest on more than 50 different cryptocurrencies, including many of the up-and-coming altcoins that investors are most excited about holding right now.  Cryptocom’s offering is very attractive, especially when you consider that you can earn interest on crypto up to 14.5% for coins like USDC. The platform enables you to choose from flexible terms (withdraw your money anytime) or fixed 1- and 3-month staking terms. A handy rewards calculator helps you figure out the optimal balance of coins and staking to get the returns you want.  * **BlockFi - 10 popular stablecoins**  BlockFi is another industry leader when it comes to helping investors earn interest on crypto. The platform offers interest on 10 popular stablecoins, including USDC, PAX, Tether, DAI, and more. You can also earn interest on ultra-popular coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.  BlockFi’s interest account is relatively new, so the platform is still under development. This makes it a little less beginner-friendly than other options, but you can access most of the functionality of the interest account through BlockFi’s wallet app. All staking on BlockFi is fully flexible, meaning you can withdraw your coins at any time without penalties or fees.  * **Binance - Wide range of options to earn crypto**  Binance is one of the most comprehensive platforms for earning interest on crypto. It’s especially suitable for experienced crypto users who want to invest aggressively in up-and-coming projects that offer higher interest rates in exchange for higher risk.  Binance offers 2 different categories of staking options: staking that guarantees your principal, and staking that doesn’t. Since your risk is significantly higher when your initial investment isn’t guaranteed, these coins can offer interest rates up to 178%. Guaranteed staking options offer a maximum rate of 104%.  * **Midas Investments - Highest yields on BTC, ETH, USDT**   [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) is a custodial crypto-investment platform with its single mission — to provide passive income streams to crypto investors. With more than 40 coins available on the platform, there’s a wide range of options for investing. The interest rates are particularly attractive, especially on the more popular coins such as BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, and DeFi market. Most of their crypto assets boast close to 15% interest rates on average.  Midas system is equipped with several investment robots and automatic balancing. Their system is equipped with several investment robots and automatic balancing. There are no investment limits, no lock-up periods, and rewards are paid every day.  For novice users, Midas Investments offers Yield Automated Portfolio - one of the most popular forms of investment. This portfolio has the option to invest in several of the largest cryptocurrencies.  * **Coinbase - Best crypto interest account for beginners**  Coinbase offers a simple, beginner-friendly crypto interest account. It’s relatively conservative, with only 5 coins and interest rates up to 5.00%. So, Coinbase’s interest account is a good option for those just starting out rather than investors who are looking to aggressively maximize their potential returns.  With Coinbase, you can earn interest on Ethereum, Algorand, Cosmos, Tazos, DAI, and USD Coin. Rates drop as low as 0.15% APY for USDC, which is actually less than some savings accounts offer for storing fiat currency.  The nice thing about earning interest on Coinbase is that staking is built right into the Coinbase Wallet app. The crypto wallet is also integrated with the Coinbase crypto exchange, creating a closed-loop ecosystem for managing your cryptocurrency. It’s hard to beat the simplicity and convenience of Coinbase.�17�0

Ethereum usage may increase exponentially and may still need the help with the demand.  Will L2 like zkRollups still be able to complement Ethereum? I'm trying to understand how roll-ups will be improved exponentially as well to follow Ethereum's improving data.

Every node in the network can verify the data. This high level of transparency provides room for rich data analysis and ensures that everyone can verify access.  2️⃣ Immutability  The data in the blockchain cannot be changed. Every block in the network that contains transaction details and other information uses encryption principles and hash values.  3️⃣ Interoperability  Blockchain enables interoperability by connecting different blockchain systems to ensure seamless cross-chain transactions.  4️⃣ Decentralization  The decentralized environment of blockchain ensures the transfer of control from a central authority to a distributed network. Decentralization offers its users the benefits of a trustless environment, improving data consistency and reducing weak points.�3�0

In addition, the National Securities and Stock Market Commission will formulate and implement a policy in the field of virtual assets; determine the procedure for the turnover of virtual assets; issue authorizations to VA service providers; exercise supervision and financial monitoring in this area.

2022-03-21 19:53:21�tjke25�After the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, traders are betting on ETH Staking�Crypto traders are concentrating on advancements inside the crypto ecosystem, notably Ethereum's approaching proof-of-stake merging and the optimistic implications for than on Ethereum. Last week, Ethereum researchers successfully tested the long-awaited Eth 2.0, a long-awaited merger of the programmable blockchain's proof-of-work and proof-of-stake chains that would allow users to keep funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support network operations in exchange for freshly created coins. As a result, staking is comparable to passive investment.   Crypto currency has come a long way, a decade ago we had the blockchain and now we have smart contracts and staking, and my interesting projects like SocialGood, Fantom, Avalanche… We will see Ethereum being used for more than monkey NFTs and it’s utility will truly shine. The mainnet launch is expected to take place by the end of June, following the successful completion of the merging test run. Observers predict that after the Eth 2.0 upgrade is completed, institutional adoption will rise. Proof-of-stake is a more ecologically friendly consensus process than proof-of-work, which compensates miners with coins for solving challenging mathematical problems in order to confirm transactions. Today, the deposit contract has almost 10 million ether locked in it. Finally, the merger is expected to turn ether into a deflationary, or store-of-value, asset, similar to bitcoin. Following the merger, the quantity of ETH released is expected to plummet by 90%, resulting in comparable levels of fees reducing the supply of ether by as much as 5% every year.�84�0

2022-03-21 17:58:56�tjhry2�What is Convex Finance (CVX)? Everything You Need to Know�Convex Finance is a yield-aggregator platform for Curve Finance – one of DeFi’s biggest decentralized exchanges. In order to understand Convex, first one needs to understand Curve – the platform upon which Convex is built.   Curve is mainly known for its favorable rates when trading stablecoins, and for the attractive returns that users can earn for providing liquidity to the DEX. When users deposit their stables into a Curve pool, they are providing their funds to be the counterparty to trades through the exchange. In return, they earn trading fees and incentives in Curve’s native governance token, CRV.   The fees earned through liquidity provision are automatically compounded into the pool, but the governance tokens are not. If a user wishes to reinvest, they must claim the CRV (a taxable event), sell the CRV (another taxable event) for stablecoins, and then deposit those stables back into the pool. Not only are these events taxable, but the process itself is extremely time-consuming and can be extraordinarily expensive to process these transactions on the Ethereum network! This is where Convex Finance comes in.   Convex is a yield-aggregator, meaning that a user can stake their Curve LP tokens on the platform and it handles all of the compounding automatically. Further, it adds an additional incentive on top of the rewards in the form of CVX tokens, the governance token of Convex Finance.    Therefore, yields on Convex are even higher than what is available on Curve due to these additional incentives. This is why Convex Finance has attracted so much TVL – over $14.8 Billion at the time of writing!   **cvxCRV**  But that’s not all. Curve’s platform also has a veCRV (vote escrowed CRV) tokenomic model. Users can lock their CRV tokens for up to 4 years and vote on which pools receive CRV incentives, and boost their own earnings up to 2.5x! These CRV that are locked cannot be unlocked early, nor can they be traded. That’s where cvxCRV comes in.   Instead of locking CRV on the Curve platform, users can lock through the Convex platform and receive cvxCRV instead of veCRV. Convex holds the veCRV in the background, and rewards cvxCRV – a tradable version of veCRV – to the depositor. cvxCRV earns trading fees from the Curve platform (same as veCRV), earns CRV as a share of Convex’s platform fees, and receives CVX rewards as an added incentive. At the time of writing, Convex is offering over 38% APR on Curve deposits. The veCRV that Convex holds in the background boosts the pools on Convex, making the Convex platform even more profitable for users.   **How Convex Finance Earns Their Money**  Similar to CRV, CVX can be locked to earn platform fees, and give voting weight for CVX emissions. Convex takes a share of CRV earnings for all deposits on the platform. All CRV that is earned by the platform is converted into cvxCRV through the same process described above. This cvxCRV is paid to CVX lockers, to the tune of 3.5% APR at the time of writing. Convex also offers a staking option without a lock, but it earns a slightly lower APR.   [Learn how to start staking CVX with roughly up to 30% APY](https://midas.investments/).  **Summary**  Both Curve and Convex are important parts of the DeFi economy. As the DEX with the highest amount of liquidity, the returns offered by Curve and Convex are the anchor of DeFi, as many other platforms are built off of these. By harnessing boosted CRV rewards and accumulating massive voting power, Convex has ensured its longevity and ability to offer the best returns on Curve pools. This ensures long-term viability for CVX tokens, in that there will always be an income stream for them.   * Total supply: 100,000,000 CVX * Circulating supply: 54,630,17 CVX * Market Cap: $1,093,841,265 * Network: Ethereum�10�0

I've noticed an increasing trend with physical products in the Web3 and NFT space so I highlighted some ideas and also ways I can help with my previous logistics and eCommerce experience!  &#x200B;  * With the oversaturation of the NFT space currently, it is getting harder for projects to stand out and gain traction. Over the last 6 months with hundreds of projects releasing a day across different chains, about 98% of those projects fail. * Across those successful projects, a common trend is a promising roadmap that is actively executed. And more importantly, some sort of utility or item supplied at the time of or closely after mint. Many recent projects have started looking into supplying physical products at or right after mint. This has had increasing success as it proves the team is capable of executing their roadmap early on as well as a major selling point for people who are passionate about the project. Exclusive merch and products helped Good Morning Groundhog’s project sell out as they were one of the first projects to ship out exclusive hoodies the week of mint. * Any protocol or project in the Blockchain/Web3 space can benefit from giving out or selling merch at hacker houses, conferences, or to users. From marketing for your project to expanding your network, everyone in the Web3 space loves free stuff and supports one another as we all try to make it. * Currently, I am starting a sourcing and fulfillment company to help protocols and projects incorporate physical products into their ecosystem. We create custom merchandise from scratch starting with the fabric and can customize the products to any criteria. We’re able to customize, source, and handle fulfillment for any products from custom shoes to jewelry to keychains for example depending on what fits best for your project's roadmap. * I'd love to hear in the comments what everyone's working on and give some insight into steps you could take to incorporate the growing physical side of the market. * I’m happy to consult with you to see what the best fit is for what you’re trying to accomplish. Feel free to DM us on Twitter: @ BlockFill   [https://twitter.com/block\_fill](https://twitter.com/block_fill)   and as always WAGMI.�1�0

2022-03-21 12:22:21�tjajxv�List of Crypto Tax Guides by Country�I’ve noticed that many Redditors have been having difficulty declaring their cryptocurrency taxes. Therefore, I’ve looked around the web to find handy guides and resources on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies in varying countries. I’ve generally tried to keep the number of guides per country to one. If I think sources are complementary, I’ve included two.   Because tax regulations on cryptocurrencies aren’t well defined in every country, I have not added countries for which I could not find a solid guide. However, if a country is missing and you’ve found a reliable guide for it that I can add, do let me know.     These guides are not referral links. I am simply trying to provide access to information that may be beneficial for your cryptocurrency tax declarations.    ### North America      **Canada**  [Canada Guide for cryptocurrency users and tax professionals - Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/digital-currency/cryptocurrency-guide.html)      **Mexico**  [Overview of Mexico’s Crypto Taxation](https://lukka.tech/overview-of-mexicos-crypto-taxation/#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20tax%20rule,including%20the%20use%20of%20cryptocurrency.)         **United States**      [Frequently Asked Questions on Virtual Currency Transactions - IRS](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions)      [Cryptocurrency & Bitcoin Tax Guide (2022 Edition)](https://www.cointracker.io/blog/crypto-tax-guide)           ### Europe      **Austria**  [Kryptosteuer-Guide](https://kryptosteuerguide.com/at)      **Denmark**  [Guide to declaring crypto taxes in Denmark (2022)](https://divly.com/en/guides/denmark)      **Finland**  [Guide to declaring crypto taxes in Finland (2022)](https://divly.com/en/guides/crypto-taxes-finland)      **France**  [France Crypto Tax Guide 2022](https://koinly.io/guides/crypto-tax-france/)      **Germany**  [Bitcoin and Tax:Cryptocurrencies in Your Tax Return](https://taxfix.de/en/finance-tips-in-germany/cryptocurrency-in-tax/)      **Ireland**  [Ireland Crypto Tax Guide 2022](https://koinly.io/guides/crypto-tax-ireland/)      **Lithuania**  [Cryptocurrency Taxation in Lithuania](https://tet.lt/blog/cryptocurrency-taxation-in-lithuania/)      **Netherlands**  [Guide to declaring crypto taxes in The Netherlands (2022)](https://divly.com/en/guides/netherlands)      **Norway**  [Guide to declaring crypto taxes in Norway (2022)](https://divly.com/en/guides/norway)  **Poland**  [ Cryptocurrencies and PIT - PIT settlement in 2022](https://www.e-pity.pl/podatek-pit-od-kryptowalut/)  **Slovakia**  [Revenues from the sale of virtual currency as a non-entrepreneur](https://podpora.financnasprava.sk/293880-Pr%C3%ADjmy-z-predaja-virtu%C3%A1lnej-meny-u-nepodnikate%C4%BEa)      **Spain**  [Spain Crypto Tax Guide 2022](https://koinly.io/guides/crypto-tax-spain/)      **Sweden**  [Guide to declaring crypto taxes in Sweden (2022)](https://divly.com/en/guides/sweden)      **Switzerland**  [Crypto Tax Switzerland: 2022 Guide](https://koinly.io/guides/switzerland-crypto-tax-guide/)      **UK**   [The Definitive Guide to UK Crypto Taxes (2022)](https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/uk-crypto-tax-guide)                 ### Oceania  **Australia**  [Crypto Tax Australia Guide 2022](https://swyftx.com/au/blog/crypto-tax-australia-guide/)         **New Zealand**  [Cryptoassets for individuals](https://www.ird.govt.nz/cryptoassets/individual)           ### Asia  **Hong Kong**  [Taxation of digital assets in Hong Kong](https://home.kpmg/cn/en/home/insights/2020/04/tax-alert-8-hk-taxation-of-digital-assets-in-hk.html)      **India**  [Crypto Tax India: Ultimate Guide 2022](https://koinly.io/guides/crypto-tax-india/)      **Japan**  [Cryptocurrency Tax Guide for Japan](https://coinpanda.io/crypto-taxes-japan/)    **the Philippines**   [Cryptocurrency Taxation in the Philippines: An In-Depth Guide](https://www.taxumo.com/blog/cryptocurrency-taxation-philippines-guide/)   **Singapore**  [IRAS e-Tax Guide: Income Tax Treatment of Digital Tokens](https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/e-tax/etaxguide_cit_income-tax-treatment-of-digital-tokens_091020.pdf?sfvrsn=91dbe1f7_0)           ### Africa      **South Africa**  [South Africa Crypto Tax Guide 2021](https://koinly.io/guides/crypto-tax-south-africa/)        ### South America      **Brazil**  [Cryptocurrency in Brazil: a fiscal guide for those who want to invest in virtual money](https://drummondadvisors.com/en/2021/09/02/cryptocurrency-in-brazil-a-fiscal-guide-for-those-who-want-to-invest-in-virtual-money/)�24�0

Snapshot.org is a decentralized and baseless voting system which allows anyone to propose and vote on a governance poll. Previously, r/ethtrader’s contrib (the points a user receives for their posts/comments to the sub) were ONLY claimable on mainnet. Due to Donuts being separately distributed on the now Gnosis Chain, people would often decide against claiming their contrib on mainnet, due to the high gas fees they had to pay.  Therefore, a majority of users on the Gnosis Chain didn’t have any governance weight, which effectively defeated the purpose of Donuts being governance tokens. Users who had also provided liquidity to uniswap or honeyswap didn’t have any governance weight reflected when they voted on governance polls. However, now, With the move to snapshot, every user has their vote fairly counted, regardless of if your donuts are on Xdai, mainnet, or in the form of liquidity tokens.   A user’s lifetime contrib has already been airdropped to their XDAI address in the form of an untransferable token. Now, everyone who holds donuts, regardless of the form, can have their weight count fairly and their voice adequately heard. [here’s the snapshot link ](https://snapshot.org/#/ethtraderdao.eth) if anyone wants to check out the ethtrader DAO snapshot. Looking forward to partaking in a streamlined governance experience!�4�0

2022-03-22 11:48:18�tk14qa�Traders Bet on Ether Staking After Ethereum 2.0 Upgrade. Ether staking yields are likely to be in the range of 10% to 15% following the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, one trader said. If so, $6,000 ETH on or before the merge!!! GLTA!!!�"After enduring weeks of macroeconomic-driven nervousness, crypto traders are focusing on progress within the crypto ecosystem, particularly on smart contract blockchain Ethereum's impending proof-of-stake merge and the bullish implications for its native token, ether (ETH).  ""I am very bullish on ether for the summer as ether staking would offer returns better than real or inflation-adjusted yields in traditional markets after the merge,"" Alex Kruger, a trader and analyst, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  [I just crossed the USD$10K mark in ETH2 rewards via staking!!! I'll continue to Stack, Stake and HODL ETH to Richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/7q6wa64baxo81.jpg?width=1130&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f32854811c6898bead83080f6103954da329eb9b)  Last week, Ethereum developers successfully tested the long-awaited merge of the programmable blockchain's proof-of-work and proof-of-stake chains, dubbed Eth 2.0, which will allow users to hold coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support network operations in return for newly minted coins. Thus, staking is analogous to passive investing.  According to Kruger, ether staking yields are likely to be in the range of 10% to 15%. Blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock expects the yields to be higher than the U.S. consumer price index, which stood at a four-decade high of 7.9% in February.  ""Through the merge with the proof-of-stake chain, fees previously earned by miners will pass on to being earned by those staking. This is expected to result in staking rewards between 7% and 12%,"" IntoTheBlock said in its weekly newsletter published on Friday.  Investors are likely to prefer any asset or investment strategy offering positive real yields. Most traditional investments are currently yielding negative returns when adjusted for inflation. In crypto, the popular bitcoin cash and carry trade now yields -4.9% in real terms, while depositing ether in the liquid staking protocol Lido yields an inflation-adjusted return of -3.9%.  Eth 2.0 to attract institutions  With the merge test run completed successfully, researchers expect the mainnet launch to happen by the end of June. Observers foresee increased institutional adoption once the Eth 2.0 upgrade is complete.  ""I'm quite optimistic. Estimates for post-merge yield are at 10% and above. Plus, moving to proof-of-stake means it's easier for institutions to adopt it since they don't need to defend the energy consumption part of investment argument associated with bitcoin and proof-of-work coins,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in a Telegram chat.  The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work, which rewards miners with tokens for solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions. That process is energy-intensive. Some sources say bitcoin mining has a carbon footprint equivalent to developed nations, which has deterred institutions from adopting the cryptocurrency. The U.S. electric-car maker Tesla suspended bitcoin payments last year, citing environmental concerns associated with mining.  ""The Beacon Chain \[deposit contract launched in December 2020\] introduced staking but didn't change how Ethereum fundamentally works. That all changes in 2022 when it merges with the mainnet, making the significant consensus change, reducing energy consumption by 99.95% and eliminating a carbon footprint the size of Finland,"" Ruben Merre, CEO of crypto wallet NGRAVE, said in a LinkedIn post.  Over 10 million ether are locked in the deposit contract, CoinDesk reported early this month.  Store of value and scalability  Lastly, the merge is likely to make ether a deflationary, or store-of-value asset, a narrative primarily tied to bitcoin. ""Following the merge, the amount of ETH issued is projected to drop by 90%, which would lead similar levels of fees to reduce ether’s supply by as much as 5% a year,"" IntoTheBlock noted.  Ether's pace of supply expansion has already slowed. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559 implemented in August introduced a mechanism to burn a portion of fees paid to miners. Since then, more than 2 million ETH – worth over $5.78 billion – have been destroyed, leading to a net supply reduction of 65.2%, according to data source Watch the Burn.  Some experts said the sharding upgrade due after the merge will be a more significant bullish catalyst. Sharding refers to splitting the entire Ethereum network into multiple portions called shards to spread the load. The change is designed to ease network congestion and boost transaction speeds.  ""After the merge comes sharding, through which scaling is facilitated,"" Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, said. ""Will it signal that Ethereum’s status as the dominant Web 3 blockchain is truly deserved and sustainable? The gas fee will not be instantly resolved, in my opinion, as interest could surge and hence gas fee too, but it will be exciting to watch first move advantage and ability to attract developers, there would be less reason for crypto projects to opt for any of Ethereum’s rivals.  ""For me, it’s all about the speed of transactions using shard chains, making it much more energy-efficient and ultimately paying lower fees,"" Kssis added.  Ether rose 13% past week, the biggest gain in seven weeks, CoinDesk data shows. On March 15, more than 180,000 ETH were withdrawn from centralized exchanges, indicating a decline in the number of coins available for sale in the market.  ""Last time such a magnitude of ETH left exchanges was in Oct 2021, preceding a 15% price increase within ten days,"" IntoTheBlock noted in its Telegram channel.  The cryptocurrency was recently trading near $2,900, representing a 1% gain on the day.  Edit (12:32 UTC): Corrects the dollar value of ETH staked in the deposit contract to $5.78 billion. The previous version said $5.78 million."�0�0

[The ETH price has surged 6%](https://swapzone.io/currencies/ethereum?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo)as of press time crossing the crucial resistance of $3,000 levels.  Even Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a 3.5% jump with its price moving past $42,200. On the weekly chart, Ethereum is up nearly 20% which is 2x against Bitcon’s gains of 9%. Clearly, ETH has been leading the show over BTC.  [The recent price rally for Ethereum (ETH)](https://swapzone.io/currencies/ethereum?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=promo) comes on the backdrop of a strong fundamental buildup taking place. Over the last week, exchanges witnessed some staggering ETH outflows.

2022-03-23 17:37:50�tl3ikr�What is your experience on play-to-earn games?� For the past two years, I've been very interested in cryptocurrency, NFTs and crypto games, P2E crypto games, and GameFi in general, all of which are poised to become an exciting component of the decentralized ecosystem in the near future, and I believe they may one day become one of the most popular games available, thanks to their intriguing developments and appealing financial incentives. The thought of playing crypto games to earn money has gotten into my head so much that I've been trying to get into it. I've looked all over the internet, including here on Reddit and on Facebook, and I'm still unsure how to get started.  I came across the the following sites:  [Engntoken](https://engntoken.com/) \- is a blockchain-based game mechanics engine that makes blockchain game development easier. It's nice because ENGN will provide a platform where developers can showcase their games and also fund them through the ENGN Blockchain Ecosystem. Finding a platform where developers can really showcase their game and also get funding is really difficult nowadays, and because ENGN uses blockchain technology, it will provide a transparent and secure place for game distribution while also ensuring that developers are fairly compensated for their work. The play is a comedy. Game mechanics allow players to win real crypto money tokens by accomplishing specific activities in the game. It could be building or developing in-game assets before selling them, or accomplishing objectives or winning matches.  [Plantvsundead](https://plantvsundead.com/) \-  Plant vs undead is a NFT multiplayer tower defense game where players have to come up with a strategic plan to eliminate undead monsters from invading your NFT garden in each wave. The game uses PVU Tokens which you can can be used in any in-game transactions, the thing i enjoy the most is that the token is used as money in the marketplace for trading in-game NFT assets; Plants, and Land Plots for planting trees It can be transferred between players on a private chat room  Battleofguardians -  The first real-time multiplayer NFT platform is Battle of Guardians. This Unreal Engine-developed sci-fi game features three different character types: humans, demons, and guardians, as well as an interesting tale involving technology, portals, and more. There are several game modes to choose from, including arena mode, story mode, and tournament mode, each with its own set of obstacles.  NFTs are the most common way for gamers to make money in Battle of Guardians. You can win more rewards as you go through the game, but if you want to compete in a tournament, you'll have to pay an admission fee. The official marketplace in Battle of Guardians allows you to trade NFT characters with other players or even sell them  [Axieinfinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) \- Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based game in which players buy NFTs of cute creatures and fight them in battles. During games, players can acquire SLP tokens, which they can then swap for cash at an exchange.  [Metawars](https://metawars.gg/)  \- In metawars, the game's native token, may be earned by completing challenges and winning battles. WARS can also be staked and used to participate in auctions and in-game governance. You can also buy NFTs in the game's auctions, which you can then sell to other players for a profit.  Gamma (or GAM) is a secondary token in MetaWars that serves as the game's principal prize token. However, it's worth mentioning that the value and market size of each of these currencies are currently quite low.  [Crypto royale](https://cryptoroyale.one/) \- Crypto Royale is a cryptocurrency won through participating in blockchain-based games. Users can join a game by joining a battlefield, and the last person standing wins a little amount of money in the form of bitcoin.  I find all these interesting but I can't decide on what way to go as I am a newbie when it comes to play to earn crypto games. What do you guys think? Any experiences on these?�142�0

2022-03-23 14:12:57�tkuuf0�Did you know that a single transaction on the Ethereum network draws as much power as the average US household for 9 Days?�According to https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption the power consumption of a single Ethereum transaction is equivalent to the power consumption of an average U.S. household over 8.96 days.  And the carbon footprint is equivalent to the carbon footprint of 327,709 VISA transactions or 24,643 hours of watching Youtube.  This is still much lower than Bitcoin though, according to https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption the power consumption of a single Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to the power consumption of an average U.S. household over 75.18 days.  And the carbon footprint is equivalent to the carbon footprint of 2,711,438 VISA transactions or 203,897 hours of watching Youtube.  After the Ethereum merge when it becomes Proof of Stake the power consumption of the Ethereum network should decrease by about 99.95%, then all the crypto haters can shut up about environmental impact lol.  TLDR: Wen merge.�0�0

2022-03-23 13:55:15�tkuggm�How to Create a Poll in Snapshot�Given ethtrader had [recently moved its governance to snapshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/tkgnz4/ethtraders_governance_has_moved_to_snapshot/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in order to accurately capture people who had donuts in liquidity pools, on the xdai chain, and previously avoided claiming their contrib on mainnet due to high fees. The governance process, as a result, was mildly altered, requiring poll proposers to add the link of a snapshot poll to their Reddit poll.   So here’s how you create a poll on snapshot in 10 easy steps   Step 1. Head over to [Ethtrader DAO’s Snapshot site](https://snapshot.org/#/ethtraderdao.eth)  Step 2. Connect your wallet (usually metamask if you signed up for donuts and haven’t imported your seed elsewhere). You may also be prompted to sign a message now and when you submit the poll  Step 3. Make sure that you’re following the governance rules [as outlined here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance/)  Step 4. Click new proposal   Step 5. include the same title and description as in the Reddit post, and maybe click preview to make sure it looks alright  Step 6. Make sure single choice voting is selected (selected by default, don’t change)  Step 7. Have only the options yes, no, and optionally abstain from voting. Yes and no can have some additional text describing what your voting for/against   Step 8. Go to voting process and make sure the poll runs for a minimum of 5 days ( can be set by modifying the end calendar date)   Step 9. Publish!  Step 10. Link the snapshot poll to your poll proposal on Reddit   Here’s the process in images: https://imgur.com/a/mwDKFOQ�3�0

Anyone who interacts with the contract before it closes (March 31, 11:59 UTC) may find themselves earning something extra...probably nothing XD.  &#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/snp8celqs4p81.gif  **🍩 What is/are Donut Quests?**  ​ For background, the [Donut Quests](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/ombg8a/donut_initiative_xdai_defi_quests/) initiative was was the very first r/Ethtrader Donut Initiative, proposed about 8 months ago. The goal was to encourage our users (especially new users) to experience the ethereum ecosystem and learn about DeFi, staking, lending, NFTs and lots more by completing quests and earning rewards on side-chains and L2s with near zero transaction fees.  After a bit of a hiatus, the project was picked back up and is now ready for some testing and fine-tuning! At this point, we have ~~4~~ 2 quests available, but more can and will be added in the future. The site design is still in the works, but the contracts and web3 integration should work as expected.  Please check out the dApp ( [https://www.donutquests.xyz/](https://www.donutquests.xyz/)), claim some rewards, and then stop back here to share your thoughts!  &#x200B;  🚨 **Need some help?**  u/Jake123194 posted a great guide for all the current quests [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/tfulq9/donut_quests_guide/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). We can also answer questions below.  \*\**Please note, the two Quests related to Agave are paused right now as the Agave reviews the implications of the recent exploit.*  &#x200B;  Lots of thanks to everyone who helped and continued to help, especially u/UrMumGaEe, who did the majority of dev work on this!�167�0

He tried Metamask and Uniswap.      AFAIK he is doing everything right, I assisted him each time. It either doesn't go through at all or it deducts a minimum gas fee and says the transaction failed.

Many competitors are here and ETH transactions are getting costlier and latency is on the rise. But its got first mover advantage.   I missed the boat buying it at around $200 in 2017 and own a tiny amount. I do mine a little of it to understand it better.  With the move to proof of stake looming ahead, would this be a good time to buy some?  Honestly I can afford to buy 2 or 3 ETH at the current rates.  Am just hoping for 2x-4x returns. Too much to ask for?�6�0

2022-03-24 00:18:37�tlntxl�ANZ the first bank to mint an Australian dollar stablecoin, the A$DC�Source : https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/anz-the-first-bank-to-mint-an-australian-dollar-stablecoin-the-a-dc-20220323-p5a743   In a landmark transaction for the digital economy, ANZ Bank has created a stablecoin pegged to the Australian dollar, reducing the risk of buying digital assets for its client Victor Smorgon Group and encouraging more customers towards crypto.  It is the first time an Australian bank has minted a digital asset linked to the value of the Australia dollar, and may be the first time a bank anywhere in the world has created a stablecoin that has been used in a real transaction. It comes as the federal government considers new laws to help Australia become a leading jurisdiction for digital assets.   ANZ expects demand for A$DC to soar. Will Willitts  The move will boost ANZ’s credentials as major banks race to develop new forms of money, and will be closely watched by rivals and regulators.  A stablecoin is a type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to another asset, in this case the Australian dollar. They are often used as a gateway for accessing other cryptocurrencies, or to earn income in decentralised finance systems.  Stablecoins interacting with blockchain technology, which removes intermediaries, can settle transactions in close to real time. This reduces risks from delayed settlement for banks and their customers.  The pilot transaction allowed Victor Smorgon Group, the investment company of Melbourne’s billionaire Smorgon family, to send $30 million to a digital asset fund manager, Zerocap, within 10 minutes. This compares to several days using existing systems.  It allowed Victor Smorgon Group to avoid the costly conversion of Australian dollars into US dollars before buying a US-dollar stablecoin known as USD Coin (USDC), which Zerocap uses to access cryptocurrency markets for Victor Smorgon. It will now be able to use ANZ’s coin to buy crypto assets, like bitcoin or ethereum’s ETH, directly at lower cost.  ANZ expects demand for its Australian dollar stablecoin – which it calls A$DC (pronounced “A dollar DC”) – to soar as more investors look to buy digital versions of real-world assets and trade them on blockchain technology.   ANZ’s Nigel Dobson: “We see our digital coin will be programmable for our customers’ needs.” Janie Barrett  “We anticipate the digital asset economy will accelerate and a foundational element will be a digital Aussie dollar,” said ANZ banking services lead Nigel Dobson.  “Our customers want to buy digital assets and seeing a digital Australian dollar minted by a large ADI [authorised deposit-taking institution] like ANZ will make them confident they can transact with us, and use the coin domestically. This means they don’t have to flip in and out of US dollar coins, taking exchange risk in an elongated process.”  The deal shows Australian banks can create alternatives to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The Reserve Bank is exploring creating a CBDC for the wholesale and retail market. Bank offerings also present competition to private technology players creating stablecoins.  In the United States, USDC, one of the most popular stablecoins, has been created by Circle, a non-bank. A working group established by US President Joe Biden wants stablecoins to be issued by regulated banks to protect users and financial system stability.  Australia has no equivalent of USDC or TerraUSD (UST), another popular US-dollar stablecoin. Private Australian dollar stablecoins include the Australian Dollar Token (AUDT); TrueAUD, created by US company TrustToken; and XAUD. But these have not gained major traction, are not supported by mainstream crypto exchanges, and do not offer enough liquidity to be useful for most investors.  While ANZ’s A$DC will initially be targeted to institutional clients, it expects it will ultimately be listed on an Australian licensed crypto exchange to help facilitate digital asset transactions in retail markets.  ANZ is working with its regulators, including APRA and AUSTRAC, to ensure they understand the offering. ANZ said Australian dollar cash would be held $1 for $1 in a trust to fully back the A$DC. The bank sees itself changing the form of money, without creating new supply.  ANZ is working with several advisers to create consumer protections. These include Zerocap, which has created custodial infrastructure and is keen to be regulated under the new Australian crypto licensing regime once it is established.  Both ANZ and Zerocap use accounts at Fireblocks, a certified global digital asset custodian, to transfer the stablecoin between them. Chainalysis is providing assurance around regulatory obligations, while OpenZeppelin has audited the smart contracts.  “There is inherently a lot of trust that comes with ANZ, and if the A$DC is traded on open market it should hold its peg as long as the market has confidence the one-to-one backing is there,” said Ryan McCall, the CEO of Zerocap.  “The Reserve Bank will be very interested in how this plays out, as will the other banks. Ultimately, whether it remains with ANZ, or becomes a joint venture with the RBA or other banks, remains to be seen.  “But it is great ANZ can, operating within the regulatory framework, move forward with this initiative. It is very significant for Australia and the ecosystem as a whole and, as far as I am aware, this is a world first for a bank to issue a stablecoin.”  A group of US banks, including New York Community Bank, FirstBank, Sterling National Bank and Synovus, said in January they planned to create a stablecoin to be known as USDF. But transactions have not been conducted.  Senior lawyers working in the digital asset space described ANZ’s involvement as groundbreaking.  “Banks are a natural fit for an AUD stablecoin issuance, bringing decades of trust to a novel product which will see faster mainstream adoption with the imprimatur of a major bank,” said Michael Bacina, a partner at Piper Alderman.  “There have been a variety of privately issued stablecoins which are in the marketplace but uncertainties around the status of those coins has kept them from being listed on exchanges. I expect a bank issued ERC-20 stablecoin [a standard on the Ethereum blockchain] to be swiftly made available across major exchanges.”  The transaction for Victor Smorgon took place on the ethereum blockchain, which Mr Dobson said involved a relatively high cost compared to traditional payment systems given congestion on the ethereum network had pushed up transaction fees, known as “gas fees”. However, ANZ expects transaction costs to fall under a new version of ethereum set to launch mid-year. It is also preparing for A$DC to work on alternative blockchains, including Hedera.  Banks are a natural fit for an AUD stablecoin issuance.  — Michael Bacina, Piper Alderman  ANZ’s move shows that as crypto comes into the mainstream, banks are keen to provide “on ramp” and “off ramp” services to help customers access opportunities in crypto while safeguarding assets.  “Everyone thinks it is banks versus crypto, but that is not the case. You absolutely will need banks, they will turn into on- and off-ramps to provide facilities and services to come on to the crypto and digital sphere,” Egor Sidelska, co-founder of Magnet Capital, told the Blockchain Australia event this week.  “On- and off-ramps for AUD will be controlled by the banks and government but give individuals access to things like crypto and they might not even know they are interacting with a crypto back-end.”  ANZ’s move will increase pressure on the other banks to create similar offerings. Commonwealth Bank’s head of digital assets, Sophie Gilder, said this week that CBA saw the creation of “programmable currency” as a key priority to allow it to participate in the “tokenisation” of assets (creating digital versions of real-world assets, which can then be traded, boosting liquidity).  The Reserve Bank will also be monitoring developments as it considers creating a CBDC for the wholesale market, including to reduce the costs of sending money offshore, and potentially the retail market. Reserve Bank governor Phil Lowe told a banking industry event this month that tokenisation was a major theme in global payments.  A$DC could be used to buy a range of cryptocurrencies and also to allow people to access the metaverse and NFTs. ANZ said it would be programmable, allowing it to interact with smart contracts on ethereum and ultimately help facilitate atomic settlement of mortgages, allowing payments and the exchange of title to occur simultaneously.  ”We see our digital coin will be programmable for our customers’ needs,” Mr Dobson said. “Where our coin needs to speak to, or understand, communications from other smart contracts, we have an ability to design that code, to communicate with a tokenised physical asset.  “We can modify our coin for our customer needs, whereas CBDC is likely to be more generic and focused on person-person payments.  “We have a strong thesis this is the first digital asset we will be dealing with, and it will enable transactions across a range of other digital assets, be that tokenised securities or tokenised physical assets.”�0�0

2022-03-25 23:50:42�to7yoi�ERC20 tax question� I made a large amount of money on a shit coin (ERC-20 on uniswap)having very little experience with crypto, and now i need help understanding how to pay my taxes.  To start off- i understand all the very basic stuff on crypto taxes. Every transaction is taxable, short term vs. long term cap gains, etc.  This is a quesiion specific to off exchange trades on uni swap.     Just to further lay out what the trades looked like here’s a quit break down.  To purchase I : bought eth on coinbase exchange> transferred it to CB wallet> swapped eth for the shit coin on uniswap  to sell i : Swapped shitcoin back to eth on uniswap>sent eth to coinbase exchange> sold for USD 9also left some in eth and bought a lot of BTC, but most gains went back to USD)  I was a complete novice when we hit big on the shit coin, but learned a ton through the experience.  From the time this all happened in the summer of 2021, to now, I’ve been under the impression that as long as i hook up all my wallets to Cointracker (or other apps like zen ledger, etc.) then it will automatically track all my transactions off the exchange on uniswap and i’d know exactly what i owed on taxes. Well, last week as i’m connecting my wallets to cointracker, i learn that this is not the case at all, and cointracker actually has me at a loss for the year, which is very inaccurate. It registered all the eth i gained by swapping out my ERC-20 shitcoin, onto my cost basis in stead of just sales price.   basically evening out everything i made on the shitcoin.     My question is this- how do i find out exactly figure i need to claim as income, if the vast majority of my gains came from off exchange trading on uni-swap?  am i responsible to calculate my own number and cost basis/sale price on my own? without any type of 10-99B or anything? seems odd and unfair.   Any and all help is very appreciated.�2�0

If you could only have 100% of your funds in only 1 platform, would it be safer to keep it with a CEX like Coinbase, Celsius, etc? Or would it be safer to have it in defi protocols like sushiswap on polygon for example? or aave on avax or something like that?

2022-03-25 19:10:21�tnwnw5�Please help me understand Defi exchanges�   Hey yall, I'm still very new to all this.  Would anyone be able to explain with simple terms why a defi exchange is better than something like Coinbase or Binance? I understand the part where there are no intermediaries. Does that mean the fees are going to be lower on a Defi? Can I day trade on a Defi exchange?  Also, something that bugs me is that the United States is full of laws when it comes to crypto. I'm a US resident, can I still use these decentralized exchanges? Will I have the same benefits as the international users do? Or will I get stuck somewhere in the process?  What is the Goal of Defi? is it being anonymous, or simply not having that intermediary?  Last but not least, if you were starting again from the zero (like where I am now). Where would you start from? What tips would you give to yourself in the past?  I don't know who to watch on youtube, I feel like they all do paid promotions behind the scenes and for that reason I have no idea what defi exchange to start using.  Sorry if it's confusing to read, but I'm just as confused trying to understand all this lol, I hope I can get some answers here!�2�0

2022-03-25 18:13:22�tnunvm�India installing a 30% crypto tax, not counting losses, only shows how powerful crypto is and how afraid the government is of it�I think the worst part about it is that it was officially proclaimed that losses cannot overrun gains in another coin that means if you incur losses and offset them with gains, you will still be paying.   I mean, I understand that they ruled this out to stop scams and frauds online, but it just sounds like they’re trying to avoid the inevitable crypto takeover, especially within countries of South Asia, there’s a strong coalition in there taking a stronghold and a position against all of crypto.   The parliament house in New Delhi has reported:  Indians will begin paying a capital gains tax of 30% on crypto transactions in just one week after the nation’s Parliament passed a controversial tax proposal on Friday, sparking uproar and disappointment among the country's crypto industry.  That being said, I think this will be the driving force, and not just in India, pushing people into more DeFi and web 3.0 projects and ideas. When you realize that crypto is actually scaring the rulers, you begin to understand the power it holds. Meanwhile web 3 projects like Link, Aloha DeFi with its hotspot monetization, and Filecoin take the field by storm, while actually giving back the community.   It’s counter-intuitive what the people in charge are doing, the more they fight it, the stronger it gets.�236�0

Bank Leumi is the second-largest bank in the country  With the feature, investors will be able to trade and hold cryptocurrencies which, to start with, will involve ethereum. The minimum value for purchases must be approximately $15.  The move is yet to receive regulatory approval, so it could yet fall through. Pepper Invest said that it will collect tax on the transactions according to the guidelines of the Israeli Tax Authority so that customers will not need to manage tax complexities.  Who would have thought that a day would come when banks that once dreaded cryptocurrencies like Ethereum will compete with crypto exchanges and trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, Tycoon and SushiSwap to offer Ethereum trading services to their clients.�242�0

Anyone know why?�So when I staked my Ethereum, I don’t remember mentioning that they will reduce the APY. That seems a bit cheeky to me considering I can’t even take my ETH out until the merge. I have seen a few posts where ETH 2 will possibly go to around 15% APY in the future. Is this true? But what reason would they lower the APY now?�0�0

2022-03-25 16:16:56�tnpge3�The next big business in crypto is ‘staking,’ according to a top expert. Here’s how it will work. Some are predicting staking rewards of 7% to 12% post-merge. GLTA!!!�BY TAYLOR LOCKE, FORTUNE   March 24, 2022 10:07 AM PDT  A lot of people have made a lot of money in crypto the last few years.  A lot have lost money, too.  [Coinbase lowered the staking yield to 3.68&#37; APR. Many experts are now predicting staking rewards of 7&#37; to 12&#37; post-merge. If Coinbase cannot match the average yield post-merge, I will likely move my ETHs off the platform for higher stacking yields. Stack, Stake and HODL ETH to Richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/puqsdnar0kp81.jpg?width=1129&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b805fb0d86c60487a15fd76d5c931b721d0e39f4)  It makes identifying the next big trend for increasing the value of both your cryptocurrency holdings and your irl currency—aka hard cash—essential, if at least just to protect your assets.   David Lawant, director of research at Bitwise Asset Management, has his eye on the next big thing: “For the industry as a whole, we expect staking to become a big business,” says Lawant, who co-authored the CFA Institute Research Foundation's book on crypto. His firm has $1.3 billion of assets under management.  Some crypto investors are already earning an annual percentage yield of over 1,000% by “staking,” and earning a huge amount of passive income along the way.  So what exactly is staking anyway, and why is Lawant so sure it will become a big deal? And what does it have to do with the much-anticipated Ethereum “merge” that is also coming down the pike?  What’s ‘staking’?  Staking gets its name because it can only be done with cryptocurrencies that run on proof-of-stake blockchains.  Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether currently run on the proof-of-work model, in which miners must complete complex puzzles to validate transactions and create new coins. This process requires a huge amount of computer power and is often criticized due to its environmental impact.   The greener option is proof-of-stake, and Lawant is convinced staking is part of the wave of crypto’s future.  With proof-of-stake, users validate transactions according to how many coins they contribute, or stake. In return for staking more coins, users have a higher likelihood of being chosen to validate transactions on the network and earn a reward.  This reward can include an annual percentage yield, and the exact percentage depends on which blockchain is used.  For example, once Ethereum, the blockchain powering Ether, migrates to a proof-of-stake model due to an upgrade slated for this year, validators who want to stake Ether can earn yields in return for their support. That’s the “merge” that the Ether community is really excited about. The more Ether a validator stakes, the higher likelihood they’ll be picked for a reward.  Currently, Ethereum has both a proof-of-work and proof-of-stake chain running in parallel. While both chains have validators, only the proof-of-work chain currently processes users’ transactions. Once the merge is complete, Ethereum's blockchain will shift fully to the proof-of-stake chain, called the Beacon Chain, making proof-of-work mining obsolete.  The Beacon Chain already allows those who want to stake Ether to support the network and earn yields, “which today are at around 4% to 5%,” Lawant said. “Once the merge is implemented, these yields are expected to expand significantly because stakers will start receiving additional income.”   Some predict staking rewards of 7% to 12% post-merge.  Other blockchains, like Solana and Cardano, are already running under proof-of-stake. One could earn an estimated reward of 5.8% per year to stake Solana’s SOL token, while doing so with Polygon’s MATIC could result in an estimated reward of 19.5%.  Each blockchain has different requirements to stake, along with different risks associated with doing so.   This process essentially bets on the viability of the cryptocurrency being staked, which ties into the extreme amount of risk. As The Business of Business reported, “These rewards often come as tokens of the cryptocurrency itself, and if the underlying coin becomes worthless, your staking rewards become worthless too.”  Sometimes, there are restrictions on how soon you can take out your cryptocurrency after staking, certain penalties for not actively validating transactions, a minimum amount needed to stake, etc.   Nonetheless, investors are still giving it a shot.  Some cryptocurrency exchanges have also cited income made from staking.  “You can already spot early glimpses of that in the earnings results of companies like Coinbase, which cites staking as one of its leading products aside from crypto trading,” Lawant said.�0�0

2022-03-25 16:04:47�tnp6e2�Blockchain is changing the way consumers participate in the economy and how it will grow.�Projects such as brave browser have changed the way we participate in terms of privacy, security, and advertising. We get paid to watch commercials like this one!     Web3 is the logical next step in this mindset. Creators want more control over their careers than they have in the past. Their work on YouTube will not be monetized, and it will not be copied and pasted onto Instagram. If platforms promote your content solely to keep users scrolling, they won't be able to scroll.     The public is growing increasingly annoyed with social media behemoths, and not just because of polarising social discourse. They want their right to privacy restored. Content creators are in the same boat.     Now that blockchain is becoming more mainstream, I've looked into some companies that are changing the internet landscape, such as the brave browser mentioned below, and even telco companies that are incorporating blockchain into their systems, such as Elite $ELITE, Eli Mobile's official token and the first and only telco to use blockchain technology.     Despite the fact that all of these possibilities in such a short period of time seem incredible, I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Some say crypto and NFT are just fads, but projects like these are changing the game. While some projects generate hype but have no practical application, projects like these are changing the landscape.�6�0

The Stock market, Forex, Commodity futures ect... is dominated by what's known as algo/bot trading. It varies somewhere between 70% to 80% Pretty crazy huh? The Cryptocurrency markets are no different in this, as they are subject to these trading participants.  Algo/bots are programmed to buy or sell based on an array of parameters that vary in complexity. From taking long positions, scalping all the way down to Black Box (HFT) High frequency Trading. Where bots compete against other bots for profit.  Algo trading is mostly utilized by the big Investment banks, hedge funds, institutional trading firms and some retail too.  To those more knowledgeable on this matter, what are some of your thoughts?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXvbaQLB0VU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXvbaQLB0VU)�0�0

This is understandably contentious within the web3 community (though probably less so on this sub!).  But it seems to me to make logical sense. Most are tokens built upon a L1 chain (normally Ethereum), and almost none of them generate revenue from outside of that L1's ecosystem (unless they bridge, which is still a minority).  Therefore it's common sense that their ultimate price is constrained when compared to the size of the underlying ecosystem.  Is anyone else seeing it this way?  Keen to hear counter arguments that can add some detail!�34�0

Now has dropped twice I noticed. I’m barely getting 3.6% yet can’t even touch it.   At 5% interest I figure it’s not a bad move just leave it there but now it’s been dropping ever since which makes it not worth it anymore.   Anyone has any speculation on the near future? How soon are we looking at ether 2 to be online and what’s the delay?   I’m sure somewhere in the agreement they said they can adjust interest anytime but damn definitely not putting anymore ether into eth2. Giving them so much while they develop I feel like we deserve more.�8�0

Zero-day is the most dangerous form of attack because it means the vulnerability is known to hackers before Google could issue a fix. As the company admits, “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-1096 exists in the wild.” This means every Chrome user is vulnerable.  The issue seems to be quite serious, as it's the only change in this build.  To force your Chrome browser to update, go to settings and there select ""About Chrome""  Edit: this also affects Brave (or any other Chromium-based client), so please update that too."�10�0

The have a complete section that talks about decentralization and how it is reshaping economics.   Many reports and podcasts are published explaining  the metaverse and the current shift to web3. This content is actually great for metaverse coins such as MANA & SAND.    The fast adoption of cryptocurrencies like by banks makes me more bullish on crypto. These institutions have been criticizing bitcoin since its release, but nowadays are welcoming crypto. In fact, Goldman Sachs recently became the first bank to trade crypto over the counter (OTC) and the bank is likely to keep expanding its cryptocurrency offerings.  This move will likely make other banks consider OTC as a conduit for trading digital assets.  Trading Ethereum, Hbar, Alohadefi & Avalanche in your local bank will soon be as easy as taking a loan!  As crypto traders, we need to celebrate this fast adoption and use it for our benefit.�47�0

If the difficulty bomb is officially on, it will mark the end of PoW mining in Ether.�"   In today's news, Tim Beiko, the core developer of Etherpad, has released the contents of a new core developer conference, including a difficulty bomb, a Shanghai upgrade, progress of work on the Etherpad execution layer, and the Protocolicon Guild program for client developers. The details are as follows.  1., testing of the merged test network Kiln is being stepped up to ensure the security and stability of all implementations.  2., the much-anticipated Ethernet difficulty bomb is expected to arrive in June.  3. the Ethernet upgrade ""Shanghai"" is currently being drafted, the main contents of the upgrade are EVM upgrade, activation of beacon chain withdrawals, reduction of Layer2 fees and some other minor upgrades.  4. Work on the executable specification of the Ethernet execution layer is progressing well, and the next step is to coordinate the EL + CL upgrade process.  5. Protocol Guild, a project token compensation scheme designed for client developers and researchers, based on Ether, now has over 100 members and is about to launch a pilot.  Ethernet introduced the ""difficulty bomb"" design from the beginning, and the roadmap in the early Ethernet white paper included a plan to upgrade Ethernet 2.0 from a PoW consensus mechanism to PoS. The main purpose is to ensure the smooth transition of the consensus mechanism icon. As the difficulty factor increases, the difficulty of getting out blocks will rise significantly, which will eventually lead to no one mining and the PoW chain will stop being used, thus avoiding adverse effects such as bifurcation and achieving a smooth merger of Eth2 as scheduled.  At that time, ethereum PoW miners can only give up their original ethereum mining, and can only choose to pledge ethereum for PoS mining, or shift their arithmetic power to other coins with the same algorithm to continue PoW mining.  Isn't the recent strength of ETH compelling?  So where do you think, PoW's arithmetic, will go?"�3�0

Just getting that out there.  Take this hypothetical: crypto pushes forward over the next five years and we see mass adoption. Companies around the world begin accepting coins of all types as payment. Crypto market share of total /cash wealth held goes up, a LOT. People start using their crypto wallets to hold all their money. Which means, *people start taking money out of every global banking system.*   Does anyone see a world where governments have the power to step in and say *hold the fuck up buddy.* They mandate in some way that companies must revert to ONLY using fiat as form of payment. If the banks cry widespread death of or threat to their institutions, even central banks, can the government come in and render crypto utterly useless?  Even if we get to a point where crypto generates revenue for the government, why wouldn't they want to save their pals like always? Seeing as most banks have their Pol buddies in their pockets.  The masses would flip shit obviously, but is there even a chance of this happening? Would love to be pointed toward some literature or even just thoughts here. Thanks everyone!�5�0

GLTA!!!�"BY JORDAN FINNESETH, COINTELEGRAPH  The week-long uptrend in the cryptocurrency market has begun to awaken bullish crypto investors and the successful March 15 launch of the Ethereum ""merge"" on the Kiln testnet has the community excited about the upcoming switch to proof-of-stake (POS).   &#x200B;  [I have 135+ ETH currently staked at 3.68&#37; APR in ETH2 rewards at Coinbase. After the Merge, if Coinbase doesn't match or exceed average market yield, I will move my staked ETH out of their platform to capture higher yield elsewhere. Stack, Stake and HODL ETH to Richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/o8d65lxa1qp81.jpg?width=584&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2d8fc514a59ee2c6e1552ffa9212d5e2ba2f82e)  Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that since the successful launch on Kiln, the price of Ether has climbed 25% from $2,500 to a daily high at $3,193 on March 25 as traders look to lock in their positions ahead of the merge.  Here’s a look at what analysts in the market are saying could happen with the price of Ether as the merge approaches and how the switch to POS could affect its price long term.  A clear breakout from the downtrend  The turnaround in Ether price over the past couple of weeks was succinctly addressed by crypto analyst and Justin Bennett, who posted the following chart highlighting the trend reversal that has occurred.  Bennett said,  “Ether first higher high since early Nov. 2021. Probably nothing.”  The merge will be a bullish development  A deeper analysis of the effects the upcoming merge for Ethereum will have on its price was discussed by analysts from the independent global macro and crypto research house MacroHive, who noted that the merge “will have bullish implications for Ether.”  According to MacroHive, “the prospect of being able to make a passive return on staked Ether will attract more investors into the space,” while the transition to proof-of-stake “will reduce Ethereum’s energy consumption by 99.95%.”  This, in turn, will help to attract more institutional money into the Ethereum ecosystem as the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) concerns “around the energy consumption of mining/proof-of-work are mitigated.”  The merge will also have a notable impact on the circulating supply of Ether as the net issuance will undergo a significant drop-off once completed as block rewards are replaced with Ether staking yields.  MacroHive said,  “This, coupled with the ongoing Ether burning should make Ether deflationary and this should be bullish overall.”  Merge could mirror Bitcoin halvenings  A final bit of insight into the effects of the upcoming merge was put forth by options trader and pseudonymous Twitter user McKenna, who posted the following tweet likening the effects of the merge to that of Bitcoin halvenings.  The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.997 trillion and Ether’s dominance rate is 18.7%.

2022-03-26 11:34:24�tommxf�ETH going 2 and becoming mainstream means it will bring with it aspects of the real world into crypto, gambling and gaming included� As eth becomes more and more nuanced within its own field and becomes more and more appealing to institutions, the promise it has to bring with it projects and oldschool corporations comes included within a promise of bringing common aspects of entertainment from our life today.   Gambling is already a part of the crypto universe, with many projects going around focused on making gambling part of their blockchain. This too includes lottery, roulette and poker, and its growing fast. But as soon as major names start hitting the scene this will explode.   Gaming too plays a pivotal role in the growth and spread of crypto as NFT gaming was a major mover last year and even today again. Games like Axie pushed the envelope and paved the roads for many to follow in its footsteps.   This too will come included with all aspects of modern life, as the Metaverse proclaimed that it will become a real-life manifestation of second life, the game we all knew. Which also brings more attention to DeFi, DAOs and Web 3 ecosystem projects like Chainlink or even Aloha DeFi which allows users to mine tokens while sharing their hotspot data which is free for the hosts. The Metaverse might be the first of its kind but it opens up for many to follow.   Crypto is slowly becoming part, not just of our lives, dedicated crypto users already, but the normal person who has no interest in crypto. Everyone is bound to use it sooner or later.�80�0

2022-03-26 07:28:04�tojcq4�What new trends have emerged in the NFT market since the avatar craze? Even solana came to this nft scene and already giving tough competition to eth.�The NFT market has shown clear trends in three areas: composability, interactivity, and growth, resulting in the emergence of a new generation of works.   The market's enthusiasm for NFT has been detonated time and time again since the floor price of CryptoPunks broke through 100 ETH and the price of artwork on Art Blocks has consistently broken new highs.   The problems that arise as a result of the influx of a large amount of capital and users have become increasingly obvious.  As trends continue to rise eth has got competition as solana has also started in this nft craze!!  Fake paintings abound in OpenSea and hit et nunc, copycats plagiarise from multiple chains (such as Tronmeebits and SolanaPunk), and the artist generates genarts of the same theme indefinitely. Faced with these issues, we can see that the market has gone through rapid iterations as well. In recent months, three distinct trends have emerged, ushering in a new generation of works.   Similarly, I believe the metaverse will open up a plethora of possibilities.   One thing is certain: the metaverse will provide numerous opportunities for a diverse range of individuals. However, I still do not believe you should spend such a large sum of money on avatars.  For a small fee, there are tools on the market that allow you to create your own custom NFT avatar. The NFT avatar maker is one such tool.  I'm curious if, as the metaverse and tools like these gain in popularity, the scarcity of avatars will diminish�35�0

2022-03-26 07:03:56�toj1ql�Despite the challenges, the blockchain gaming industry is booming. And I think Ethereum gave the necessary push it needed to this industry!!�I think Ethereum has given a lot to the gaming community as games like cryptokitties were firstly started on Ethereum blockchain and I think it gave the necessary push it needed. More and more game studios and developers are partnering with blockchain platforms as blockchain technology continues to take the gaming industry by storm.   Blockchain gaming platforms have been valued at billions of dollars all over the world. Blockchain gaming platforms are attracting the attention of some of the world's largest gaming companies. Microsoft has paid $68 billion for Activision, and Ubisoft has joined the blockchain ecosystem with the launch of NFT.   Popular blockchain-based platforms are even attempting to revolutionise the gaming industry in India. Furthermore, the availability of blockchain games on smartphones and the internet is enticing a growing number of people to participate in blockchain-based games.  But  Many ardent gamers fear that incorporating NFTs and other blockchain-based features into games will simply provide companies with another revenue stream. Aside from token values plummeting, a number of other things can go wrong in GameFi: I've come across a few projects, one of which is xchange monster, a gaming asset and NFT exchange. Do you think the current blockchain gaming market will expand to the point where special exchanges will be required to deal with this issue?  Blockchain gaming is still a relatively new concept that is fraught with ambiguity, questions, and uncertainties. As more game studios enter the world of blockchain gaming in the coming years, misconceptions about blockchain will be dispelled, and widespread awareness will be achieved. Furthermore, the emergence of new gaming platforms as well as changing customer expectations are expected to break down barriers and propel the blockchain gaming industry forward to new heights.  Gaming platforms can overcome many challenges and create future gaming ecosystems and economies by providing ownership of in-game assets, reward and income-generating opportunities, and social interactions.�83�0
2022-03-26 07:00:56�toj0bv�I believe meme coins are a waste of time because they may be worthless in the future. Here's my take on the situation!!�(alternate title) Meme Coins Return to Earth as Crypto Fanatics Face Doom I've seen a lot of projects that have pretended to be enthusiastic but aren't. And you should have bought some useful coins early on to take advantage of the bull market while avoiding the bear market. When looking for altcoins with long-term viability, look for projects with compelling use cases, significant collaborations, and a strong leadership team. Always remember to conduct your own research, but I've been following this incredible project:  The social media meme coin frenzy is out of control, and you can't trust it! To be honest, comprehending meme coins can be viewed as a study of human psychology. What else could explain why, rather than focusing on the technical benefits of virtual currencies, people are becoming obsessed with meme coins? Simply put, meme coins work in the same way that memes do – an image, video, piece of text, or other combination that spreads among internet users while having a humorous meaning. They usually have no intrinsic value and are based on a popular internet meme. And this leads us to the next question: What's the big deal about meme coins?  Polkadot, on the other hand, is a 'blockchain of blockchains,' with the sole purpose of facilitating the creation of new networks by developers. The bob eco coin is similar to the bob eco coin in that it has a few distinguishing features. Being the world's first cryptocurrency designed for a for-profit social enterprise. They provide job placement assistance as well as Bobcoin, an Asset-Linked-and-Bound Crypto.  Because there are so many real-world problem-solving coins that trail meme coins in terms of market capitalization and popularity, I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts on efficient coins. Should we incorporate some of it into our portfolio or ignore it entirely?�26�0

But this is just a misconception.  While nothing can be expected 100% it is almost certain that Ethereum will still be needing the help of scaling solutions.  Ethereum will greatly advance in scalability after the merge indeed, but it still won’t be able to handle the pressure and traffic entirely on its own especially if the market keep on growing this fast.  Even Vitalik himself stated that Ethereum will still need scaling solutions back in 2021 when he attended the Polygon ZK summit.  Some Ethereum fans are aren’t too fond of scaling solutions but honestly I appreciate these scaling solutions if anything. Commit chains like Polygon for example helped a lot of people save up on gas fees and ended up bringing more and more users into the Ethereum ecosystem who would have otherwise been intimidated by the gas fees.  So dont go ahead and sell your MATIC and AVAX. They’re still going to be needed as ever before.�3�0

Wherever we donate donuts its a good honest cause and we would all be so proud of ourselves for doing the right thing. It may not be much yet I feel they would be so grateful.

2022-03-27 20:04:12�tpry1f�Do you agree with JP Morgan belief that Ethereum is better than Bitcoin�Crypto investors should hold ethereum rather than bitcoin in an era of rising interest rates, JPMorgan analysts said.  Ethereum is at the heart of decentralized finance and the market for non-fungible tokens, two booming areas.  Bitcoin is more akin to digital gold, which is likely to fare less well as interest rates and bond yields rise.  Crypto investors should be holding ethereum rather than bitcoin as interest rates rise, JPMorgan said, because the blockchain has more uses such as powering decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens.  JPMorgan analysts, led by market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, said in a recent report that rising interest rates could pose a problem for bitcoin, just as they traditionally do for gold. In this aspect, JP Morgan seems to be saying the truth as a myriad of people are building innovations on Ethereum like Compound, Balancer, Social Good, Curve, UniSwap and so on, but that can't be said exactly for Bitcoin.   Do you agree with JP Morgan?�531�0

Third biggest future exchange according to this side:  [https://coinmarketcap.com/de/rankings/exchanges/derivatives/](https://coinmarketcap.com/de/rankings/exchanges/derivatives/)  My experience with this exchanges so far:  Binance - Wont let me pay out fiat since like 18 month. Calls it a technic issue. Since then i had trust issues. Beside that fair fees (maker0.02%/taker0.04%) and the best liquidity in the hole market. (Last price and Market price is sometimes the same or atleast +/- 1$) Cant be used in my country anymore. Got told VPN doesnt work either.   Bybit - Sometimes shows weird Daily PNL while i didnt had a trade last days. An error they didnt fix for month? Just increased it fees ALOT. (maker0.01%/taker0.06%) promise bonuses but will never pay. so it has like only downsides compared to binance in my eyes. medium good liquidity.  Phemex - Gives you 20-100$ welcome bonus Has horrible, horrible liquidity. order book has sometimes gabs of >5$. worst orderbook i have seen in my life. Last price and Market price difference is sometimes 10$ !! best fees if you use makerfees alot like i do. (maker-0.025% rebate/taker 0.0675%, 0,075 %if you dont use the welcome code) conditional orders can only be used after buying a expensive premium account. that is a bummer. has brackets orders which i love!!

2022-03-28 19:36:07�tqhdt7�10 million ETH is currently locked into the staking contract, or about $30 over Billion! That amounts to more than 8% of the circulating supply. $6,000 ETH on or before the merge is my short-term price target. GLTA!!!�By Raphael Meyer, March 16, 2022  The Ethereum Merge is coming: what, why and when?  Ethereum Energy Consumption  Since its inception in 2015, Ethereum has been pushing through the new frontiers of cryptocurrencies, adding a block of transactions every 12 or 13 seconds on average through its Proof-of-Work consensus. Today, Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work security model is estimated to consume roughly 100 TWh per year according to Digiconomist, the equivalent of a country like the Netherland — or 3% of the US energy consumption. (The Ethereum Foundation shows a similar trend.)  &#x200B;  [To date, I've earned 3.4 ETH just from staking. Stack, stake and HODL ETH to richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/otvt2kj6f6q81.jpg?width=1134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1768afe71b85c9d09853e39263fb678d8112dfc3)  What is Proof-of-Stake?  While this is only half of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, the trend has been worrying the Ethereum community for a while. In response, a new consensus algorithm has been under development for the past few years: Proof-of-Stake. The Proof-of-Stake algorithm does not rely on solving difficult math problems as Proof-of-Work does, and so it can work with very limited computing power, and hence be much more energy-efficient.  Proof-of-State consensus replaces the “miners” of Proof-of-Work by “validators”: to participate in the consensus, validators must lock some capital (in the form of ETH) into a smart contract — that’s the staking. Validators are then chosen randomly to propose the next block or to validate someone else’s block. In return, they get a reward proportional to their stake.  &#x200B;  [My All-ETH portfolio is surging to a 1-month high!!! Up well over USD$150K in just a few weeks since the low on March the 7th. Stack, stake and HODL ETH \(5 years minimum time horizon\) to richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/2d5dosv7f6q81.jpg?width=1134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1b92218fa334a2d348e321e115d7a2a736bcb2c)  If a validator behaves fraudulently, its stake will be “slashed”: it will be taken away. This ensures that validators stay honest and keep doing their work correctly.  Proof-of-Stake replaces the heavy machinery necessary for Proof-of-Work with lightweight computing. There is no need to buy expensive equipment or spending huge amounts of electricity to participate in securing the network.  The move to Proof-of-Stake is estimated to reduce the energy consumption of the Ethereum network by 99.95%. In other words, to divide it by a factor 2,000. That would put Ethereum’s consumption in line with a country like Tonga, a Polynesian archipelago with a population of 100,000.  The Beacon Chain is already running  Even though Ethereum has not switched to Proof-of-Stake completely yet, staking had already been taking place since December 2020 on what’s called the Beacon Chain.  The Beacon chain is a chain that runs in parallel to Ethereum’s main chain and uses the Proof-of-Stake consensus. Right now, the Beacon chain does not validate any Ethereum transaction or smart contract execution, it only validates its own blocks.  While a minimum stake of 32 ETH is required to become a validator, users with less cash can gather their funds into staking pools, such as RocketPool or Staked — similarly to Proof-of-Work’s mining pool,. This allows anyone to join the staking process and participate in the Beacon chain’s security: the more Eth is staked, the more secure the network.  Of important note, ETH staked cannot currently be “unstaked” or withdrawn. This will only be implemented when Ethereum has fully completed the move to Proof-of-Stake.  Despite this restriction, 10 million ETH is currently locked into the staking contract, or about $28 Billion! That amounts to more than 8% of the circulating supply.  The Merge  Right now, Ethereum is like a spaceship running with an old engine — Proof-of-Work. It’s polluting, it’s costly, but it’s also complicated to replace.  The Beacon chain is like a newer engine, clean and energy efficient, that runs in parallel to the spaceship. It runs on Proof-of-Stake.  The final step is going to disconnect Ethereum’s old engine and swap it with the new one. This step is called the Merge, and it’s approaching very quickly. It could happen as early as this summer, according to several speakers at Eth Denver 2022.  So what will happen after the Merge?  Right now, nodes running Ethereum software (Eth1 clients) take care of both execution (transactions and smart contracts) and consensus (Proof-of-Work).  Nodes of the Beacon chain run their own software, called Eth2 clients. Eth1 and Eth2 clients barely talk to each other.  After the Merge, nodes will run these two pieces of software in parallel: the Eth1 client for execution (with Proof-of-Work disabled), and the Eth2 client for consensus. The newer piece will coordinate blocks and talk to the execution piece who will take care of contracts and transactions.  By taking this modular approach, the Merge is not reinventing the wheel. It takes what already works, turns off what is not used anymore, and only adds a newer, cleaner, engine.  What are the pros of Proof-of-Stake for Ethereum?  On top of the tremendous reduction in energy consumption, Proof-of-Stake will bring a few additional features to Ethereum.  One of the them is constant block time. In Proof-of-Work, blocks are added when they are “found”, at an average of 13 seconds between blocks, but blocks are frequently found under 3 seconds or above 30 seconds.  Since Proof-of-Stake’s random selection does not depend on solving math puzzles, the block time can be fixed. It will be exactly 12 seconds after the Merge. Predictable block times are useful for time critical applications.  Another advantage is that Proof-of-Stake gives actual finality, meaning that if a block has been approved by the validators, it won’t ever be reversed, whereas in Proof-of-Work there’s always a possibility, however small, that someone is secretly mining a longer chain and will trigger a malicious reorganisation.  Proof-of-Stake is still vulnerable to 51% attacks — like Proof-of-Work, but the risk of such attacks is mitigated as it’s even costlier to implement in Proof-of-Stake, and the financial risk is enormous for the attacker.  What Proof-of-Stake doesn’t do  The Merge is not a solution to scalability: switching to Proof-of-Stake is not going to increase Ethereum’s capacity magically. However, it’s an important step as it opens the door to sharding, the technique that allows validators to specialize in smaller parts of the transactions and smart contracts, in effect introducing parallel computing to blockchains. (The scalability roadmap for Ethereum is sharding + rollups — see below.)  The financial side  Many expect the price of Ethereum to drop significantly after the Merge. The rationale is that, after withdrawing — or unstaking — is implemented, stakers will run to cash in their potential gains.  While this may happen, in practice it will be greatly mitigated by limits imposed in the system: only about 900 validators will be allowed to exit every day, from a current total of 220,000. If validators do choose to exit, it will be a slow bleed, not a bank run!  Another important financial aspect is that, since Proof-of-Stake uses very little energy, it is not necessary anymore to issue a lot of new coins to pay the miners’ costs, which means that, with the help of EIP 1559 burning ether every day (see below), Eth could even become a deflationary asset.  Conclusion  The Merge is probably the most momentous event in the history of Ethereum. The move to Proof-of-Stake has been in the works for at least 5 years and it’s very exciting to be on the doorstep of such an event.  With billions being transacted everyday on the Ethereum network, the stakes (no pun intended) are extremely high. But, if successful, the Merge could even trigger other blockchains to switch to Proof-of-Stake. Let’s see what happens this summer.�0�0

GLTA!!!"�"By Kitco News, Monday March 28, 2022  The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, otherwise known as ""The Merge,""is expected to launch by the end of June and is ""the biggest news in crypto today,""said Ran Neuner, founder and host of The Crypto Banter, co-founder of Crypto Trader, and CEO of OnChain Capital.  [From $0.00 to almost half a million U.S. dollars worth of Ethereum!!! Stack, stake and HODL ETH through thick and thin to richest!!!

Importantly, The Merge will reduce Ethereum's carbon footprint significantly, Neuner told Michelle Makori, editor-in-chief of Kitco News.  ""Proof of work is a very high electricity consumption, very high equipment consumption way of mining cryptocurrencies or proving transactions. And it is one of the big criticisms that Bitcoin faced,""he said.  Bitcoin, which runs on the proof-of-work network, has been the subject of criticism for its environmental footprint.  Neuner noted that when Tesla CEO Elon Musk made the announcement that Tesla is accepting payment in Bitcoin, he received pushback from his Board of Directors about using a non-ESG (environmental social governance) friendly asset when the company is trying to preserve an image of being one of the greenest companies in the world.  Recently, the European Union contemplated banning Bitcoin due to its lack of ESG qualities, although members of the European Parliament voted not to ban it.  ""So, what they're doing is they're moving Ethereum from proof-of-work to a much more energy efficient proof-of-stake. It's much more energy efficient and it's much faster. The only issue is that somehow you have to combine the chains: the old proof-of-work chain and the new proof-of-stake chain,""he said.  There's also the issue of scaling that proof-of-stake aims to fix.  ""Proof of work is also not very scalable, and one of the big criticisms that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have been facing, and specifically Ethereum…which uses proof-of-work mining, cannot keep up with the transactions that are required,""Neuner said, noting that Ethereum is needed for not just investments but is being adopted by a wide range of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  Ethereum will also see its supply shrink over time, Neuner said.  ""The second thing that happens, which is very, very interesting right now, Ethereum has an uncapped supply. Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million but Ethereum has an uncapped supply, which means that theoretically, you could keep printing ETH forever and Ethereum is not scarce. But Ethereum also has another mechanism which is called a burning mechanism. When every transaction is completed we burn a certain number of Ethereum. When we destroy the net burn, they're gone forever,"" he said. ""And so the Ethereum emissions, the amount of Ethereum that are being created every day, are going to be reduced by 90%.""  Last, The Merge will reward Ethereum holders with a higher yield when the token is staked.  ""The returns today on staking Ethereum are 3.9%,""he said. ""When the merge happens, the returns on Ethereum are going to be between 10% to 15% per year.""  In theory, if the burn rate exceeds the rate at which new ETHs are being created, the supply of Ethereum would shrink indefinitely until it approaches zero, although Neuner noted that could take ""thousands of years.""  ""Ethereum becomes deflationary, so now, you've got an energy efficient, deflationary asset. Get into the mind of a fund manager. You can invest in Bitcoin, which is moderately inflationary, and heats up the atmosphere and is non-ESG friendly and deflationary,""he said. ""It's actually becoming more and more scare. Where in the world do you have the opportunity to invest in a scare asset, and by the way earn 10% to 15% return? I've never heard of it.""  Neuner himself is more heavily invested in Ethereum as compared to Bitcoin, as he sees more growth in the former.  However, the ""Ethereum Flippening,""the theory that Ethereum's market cap will overtake Bitcoin's, is still not happening anytime soon.  ""I think maybe in a couple of years, that is a discussion for it to be happening, but let's look at what's happening right now,""he said. ""For a long time, ETH was devaluing against Bitcoin until about January 2020, and since January 2020, actually that trend has been completely reversed and we're seeing ETH strengthen towards Bitcoin. Flippening…that's a little bit ambitious. For now, if you ask me, if you've got a gun to your head and can only invest in one, Bitcoin or ETH? My money's on ETH."""�0�0

2022-03-28 07:28:49�tq3v4a�Ethereum Staking Rewards�   I've been seeing a lot of people claiming that after The Merge staking rewards will grow up to 15- 20% for a period of time. I'm really struggling to see how that is possible??  It's claimed here [https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-economics/](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-economics/) that the max number of issuance for over 10 million ETH staked is 572,433 ETH for the year. I've seen similar numbers elsewhere confirming that. At the point there is 10,360,000 ETH staked and if we say that issuance will be at it's max then it equates to 5.53% APR.  The other element of staking rewards is the tips which the miners are currently receiving. Over here [https://bitinfocharts.com/ethereum/](https://bitinfocharts.com/ethereum/) they are stating that tips are currently 4.53% of the miners revenue. The mining rewards from block rewards for the last year are approximately 2,347,314 ETH. Even if we say that tips contribute 10% of total rewards that equals 260,812 ETH. The total amount of ETH rewards becomes 833,245 ETH and an APR of 8.04%.  All of this is done under the assumption that the ETH staked stays constant. I don't see any reason why it would stop increasing at this increasing rate the closer we get. Could someone explain to me what I'm missing and where I've gone wrong as I can't seem to find anymore info. Thanks�8�0

Messi becomes the latest global sports personality to enter the crypto world following NFL quarterback Tom Brady and NBA star LeBron James.  The deal is part of a growing wave of tie-ups between crypto firms and soccer.  The 'ambassador' deal for Messi does not include crypto payments and is a three-year agreement, the source said.

The crypto taxes will come into effect on April 1, while the TDS will start on July 1.

If you buy Bitcoin or Ethereum you are betting against Governments and banks with assets they can not control.

2022-03-29 15:22:22�tr4h42�Only a few years ago JP Morgan called cryptocurrency a FRAUD, now JP Morgan and other financial institutions are trying to flip each other in cryptocurrency investments!�It was only a few years ago that JP Morgan was calling cryptocurrency a fraud for years.   [In 2017,](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-raises-flag-on-trading-revenue-sees-20-percent-fall-for-the-third-quarter.html) Dimon talked on every media outlet how cryptocurrency would be disastrous.   [In 2019,](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/jp-morgan-is-rolling-out-the-first-us-bank-backed-cryptocurrency-to-transform-payments--.html) Dimon started to have a change of heart and declared a JPM coin would be created. The first bank backed cryptocurrency... he wasn't kidding, [JPM coin is real](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/cib/news/digital-coin-payments).   >JPM Coin is a permissioned, shared ledger system that serves as a payment rail and deposit account ledger, enabling participating J.P. Morgan clients to transfer US Dollars held on deposit with J.P. Morgan. JPM Coin facilitates real-time value movement, helping to solve common hurdles of traditional cross-border payments.   I thought Dimon was so stupid to call cryptocurrency a scam and a fraud for YEARS! He got the media attention he wanted, but eventually realized he was EXTREMELY WRONG. He saw his competitors get on board with cryptocurrency with investing, research, and hands-on approach by hiring developers to create what the company needed.   [In 2022,](https://decrypt.co/96284/caitlin-long-how-jp-morgan-flipped-goldman-sachs-in-crypto) news headlines are filled with institutional reach into cryptocurrency and how JP Morgan is trying to beat competitors in cryptocurrency investments and usage. How times have changed!  My point is, just like JP Morgan and Jamie Dimon was 100% against cryptocurrency and is now interested and taking part in the community is a game changer. For every cryptocurrency hater and shaker you know in the community, don't give up on them. It may take years like it did for Jamie Dimon, but eventually, they will come around and embrace cryptocurrency and digital currencies.  **TLDR:** Institutions went from calling cryptocurrency a fraud to being one of the biggest cryptocurrency investors. Cryptocurrency haters will eventually come around, even though it may take years for some! Don't give up brothers and sisters and cousins!

2022-03-29 14:43:36�tr1qyy�When the PoR mechanism is combined with ETH's extensive acceptance and powerful features, it creates an extremely efficient combination�The ETH network, which has the largest ecosystem of decentralized apps and over four million unique users worldwide, remains the undoubted leader in the field of DeFi, which has grown so popular as a result of the ETH.     I know I'm not the only one suffering from ETH issues, thus the flood of new users following the boom brought up concerns about scalability, network congestion, and pricing. These issues wreak on the ETH network and the decentralized apps that rely on it. As a result, users and developers have begun to search for potential solutions and found them in chains like Solana or Fantom.     ETH records a low throughput of less than 15 tps and every time the traffic on the network increases, the fees for processing transactions become astronomical. On DEXs like Uniswap, the gas fees for a simple swap can sometimes go as high as $50 per trade.     In this case, a proof-of-reputation consensus rather than a PoS consensus might be a valid option. The Kaiba Lightning Chain demonstrates the successful application of the PoR consensus. I noted that individuals are required to stake their identities rather than digital assets, which ensures that fraudulent players may be identified and removed from the network quickly. This protects the interests of the vast majority of fair-playing participants while allowing for scalability and cost.     I would say that the whole PoR mechanism, when paired with ETH's extensive acceptance and powerful features, results in a very efficient synergy that addresses all of the difficulties raised above.

2022-03-29 13:09:46�tqze8e�The recent hype and pump of the APE token just shows that people aren’t done with hype projects�No question about it, people love a pump & dump.   For those that missed the Bored Ape Yacht Club boat, the APE token presents a unique opportunity, for investors to get in on the hype and sell the news, and they did.   It quickly jumped up in prices and showed the world that hype machines are not over with, people still loving buying massive pumps. And for good reason, everyone loves making profit.   Let’s not lie about it and admit that we all came here to win, and when we see an opportunity like that, we will just dump all into it and wait for a chance to sell at the peak, common human greed.   Problem is, that despite being highly rewarding, it’s incredibly risky and unsustainable.   Or did you think you’ll be able to flip monkey JPEGs forever?   Honestly, I’m all for consistency. And I know that’s just old me who thinks that and that few share this opinion. That’s why when I’m staking my coins I find few who share this investment with me, and few know how rewarding it could be, and it could be very rewarding. I personally stake in defi for this sole reason, and my Werewolf stakes on the exchange have been fruitful.   DeFi staking is not as it used to be. For the longest time staking was a bank’s game with low reward and would be stretched out on a timeline of years, but nowadays you can do it for as long as you want with high APYs too.   Staking Ethereum before the 2.0 release is what most people are trying to do as of now, and people are rushing to do it. More eth is off exchanges and being staked than ever before, people know that consistency counts…   I would never advise anyone to jump into the APE token, though if you choose to do that that’s on you and I won’t stop or judge you, we’re all here to win, and each in their own unique way.�2�0

2022-03-30 17:07:25�tsb78i�xToken Terminal: Deploy a Liquidity Mining Program on Uniswap V3 - no dev required!�Uniswap, the most widely used DEX in DeFi, has brought a number of improvements with its V3 upgrade - namely, better capital efficiency via[ concentrated liquidity](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/concentrated-liquidity). But deploying a liquidity mining (LM) program on V3 right now requires technical expertise and development time - it typically requires 2-3 developer weeks.  How do we solve this? Enter,[ xToken Terminal](https://xtokenterminal.io/).  Terminal is a permissionless, no-code platform that allows projects to configure and deploy V3 LM programs in a few easy clicks - with a rich UI, a configurable contract architecture, and powerful features like rewards vesting and multi-token incentives. Terminal is great for LPs as well, allowing frictionless liquidity deployment and an end-to-end experience.  To learn more, check out our[ docs](https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/) or our [brief tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIgiWOzf6FE&t). Interested in a discussion or demo?

India’s tax authority has seized Rs. 95.86 crore (US$12.6 million) from 11 crypto exchanges on allegations of tax evasion.  The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), which oversees tax collection in India, had previously seized around Rs. 84 crore (about $11.0 million) in taxes and a further Rs. 1.1 crore ($145,000) in penalties, CoinDesk reported in January. India’s Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said the figure was closer to 95.86 crore ($12.6 million) in a statement Monday.  At this point, it is important to pay the right amount of taxes at the right time, be it from trading on Binance or earning crypto cash back when you shop on Social Good, pay your tax. The Indian government doesn't seem to be joking.�10�0

2022-03-30 11:36:20�ts4ev9�I'm glad that the crypto winter is finally over�Finally some good news! Over the last week, both Bitcoin and Ether are up about 16%, after a rocky start. On Monday, both of the major cryptocurrencies got a boost, with Bitcoin up 6.2% and Ether up 6.8%, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin was trading at $47,630 and Ether was trading at $3,387 as of Monday morning.     I must confess that I was concerned in recent months because all of this has been referred to as a crypto winter after Bitcoin fell to a low of around $33,184 and Ether plunged to a low of $2,455 in late January. However, this might be changing. Bitcoin was up roughly 43.5 percent and Ether was up 37.9 percent from their 90-day lows on Monday.     I've heard as well that Ethereum’s blockchain is nearing a huge turning point that could push Ether’s market value ahead of Bitcoin’s. And what about this Etherlite blockchain, does it have anything to do with the Ethereum blockchain? I've noticed that many platforms started using it, nOFTEN is built on it as well.     Now everyone is talking about how investors in Ether should be feeling bullish due to an upcoming update in the crypto’s underlying technology called the “merge” that could make it more environmentally friendly and introduce new revenue streams for the crypto-savvy. That update would also transform Ether from a “proof of work” blockchain, to “a proof of stake” blockchain.       How do you feel about all of these? First of all, I must say that I'm relieved that crypto winter has finally been over!�4�0

2022-03-30 10:49:02�ts3nqt�ETH price could resume increase if it stays above the $3,250 support.�Have you heard that ETH extended its increase above the $3,400 resistance zone? ETH even climbed above the $3,450 resistance and formed a high near the $3,482 level.     So, what's the deal? Recently, there was a downside correction below $3,400. The price even fell below $3,350 but stayed over $3,320. It is also trading above the $3,300 mark and the 100-hour simple moving average. On the hourly chart of ETH/USD, a big bullish trend line is forming with support at $3,250.     A low is formed near $3,335 and ether price is now rising. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,482 high to the $3,335 low.     On the upside, the first resistance level is at $3,410. It is approaching the 50% Fib retracement level of the latest slide from the $3,482 high to the $3,335 low. The next significant resistance is located at $3,450. If there is a clear move above the $3,450 resistance, ether price might begin another ascent.     If ETH does not begin a new upward trend over $3,450, it may begin another downward trend. On the downside, initial support is at $3,350. If the price falls below the $3,250 support zone, it may move towards the $3,100 level.     The only thing that worries me now is the gas fee price. Do you have any opinions on how this will affect gas prices and so on? In any case, I'm staying with Metis.   https://preview.redd.it/hbk467wp3iq81.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d269fc9699f3e6bcc774a5b260529faa1993238�12�0
2022-03-30 10:45:56�ts3m20�Ethereum Whales Are Trading This DeFi Token The Most Today�"Some interesting news I came across today says that Aave has emerged as the most traded cryptocurrency by the 1,000 biggest Ethereum wallets in the past 24 hours, as of press time late Tuesday.       Aave was also ranked sixth among the ten most purchased tokens and stood second among the most used smart contracts by the Ethereum whales during the 24-hour period, according to data from cryptocurrency data platform WhaleStats.       So, what's the big deal here? Aave is a decentralized financial system that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. The platform manages loan markets for a range of cryptocurrencies using smart contracts. Aave's primary product is ""flash loans,"" which let users borrow any amount of accessible assets without putting up any collateral, as long as the liquidity is returned to the protocol inside the same block transaction.       I somehow expected this to happen, something similar I would predict for the Kaiba token as well.       It's interesting that Aave is up 27.5% during the past 24 hours, trading at $220.32 at press time. Did you expect this to happen?"�14�0

2022-03-30 10:10:59�ts33un�Long-term investing is not a get rich quick scheme. But not Investing AT ALL ??? That's a get poor slow scheme!� In case you haven’t realized, the value of your dollar is falling off a cliff…  Inflation is running rampant and recently crossed a whopping 7%... Worse than we’ve had in about 40 years.  If you’re interested in going anywhere, it’ll cost you about 40% more than this time last year just to fill up your gas tank. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg…  If you grasp what’s going on, you’ll know that a 3% raise isn’t helping you at all when you’re losing 7%...  In order to counter this, storing money in an appreciating investment vehicle is an absolute MUST.  Otherwise, the value of your dollar will continue going down as the AMOUNT of dollar you have stays the same…  Even if you’re not great at math, I think you can see where that’s headed.�3�0

The Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro will allow the payment of a municipal real estate tax with cryptocurrencies starting in 2023, the city announced on Friday.  Through this initiative, Rio de Janeiro will become the first city in Brazil to allow the payment of a tax using cryptocurrencies. The state administration will not store crypto because payments will be immediately converted to Brazilian reais through a company that has not yet been contracted, the city added in its official statement.  I feel paying tax with ETH is like that guy that bought pizza with thousands of BTC. Heck, I won't even pay my tax in ADA, Plastik or even Monero, talk more of ETH.

2022-03-31 16:21:42�tt3gv8�Paying utility bills with crypto?�"""Not that I'm purchasing K4 Rally game tokens with ETH, but now I can pay utility bills with ETH,"" a buddy said to me a few days ago lol I thought he was joking, but it's true. Have you heard that the City of Chandler is now taking cryptocurrencies to pay utility bills?     So, what's the deal? It’s one of the latest high-tech moves for one Valley community. Chandler is now allowing residents to pay their utility bills with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin.     ""By choosing PayPal, the crypto option will automatically display as a payment method in PayPal Checkout if there’s enough to cover the payment. The option started to be offered in March after the City worked with Invoice Cloud to make the payment option available. If they choose cryptocurrency, it will convert those into dollars based on the market value at that point. It’s a very small fee compared to the credit card fee, and the city has absorbed that through our utility services area"".     Chandler may one of the first in the Valley to offer the option. Stewart said in a news release that the digital currency and blockchain are advancing quickly, and as the Community of Innovation, it is important to be at the forefront of this technology and offer it to their residents as a payment method for utility payments and other fees.     Would you like to have this payment option in your city and what do you think about it?"�7�0

2022-03-31 16:10:29�tt37wg�Buterin Claims Ethereum Simplicity is Still Possible�"Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, has stated that it is still possible to lower Ethereum's complexity while increasing its functionality. The announcement comes as several developers have lately expressed concerns about ETHs complexity.     According to what I've read, he highlighted the Gasper PoS version, which ETH would eventually integrate into, claiming that it is a difficult but highly strong system. In comparison, there are far simpler and weaker implementations of PoS that may have been acceptable contenders, but they lack Gasper's benefits.     ""Buterin detailed that Ethereum has been struggling between two visions: one that values safety and simplicity (like Bitcoin), and another that intends to make Ethereum a highly performant and functional platform for building advanced applications.""     It would be fantastic to reduce the difficulties that ETH brings us, especially when you consider the high gas prices and how busy the network is, which causes chaos. Most NFTs are minted on ETH, and you must use search engines like LUDO or something similar to find them because there are a bunch of them, therefore ETH is very important and we're using ETH on a daily basis for so many things.     ""My personal dream is to try to achieve both visions at the same time,"" he said, adding that it would take a long time and a great deal of effort to achieve this goal. However, he noted it is still possible to reduce complexity going forward."�11�0

2022-03-31 11:33:06�tsxq7u�VISA new NFT program to help small businesses into the digital economy.�Credit card giant Visa has launched an NFT creator program in an effort to bring small businesses into the digital economy.  “We’ve seen rapid growth in the NFT ecosystem over the past year,” Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, told TechCrunch. “We think NFTs represent a new form of e-commerce.”  The idea of a small business is evolving from the traditional “brick-and-mortar mom-and-pop shops” to include other independent businesses with creators and entrepreneurs who want to build digital-focused companies and harness new tools like NFTs, Sheffield said.  The one-year immersion program, the Visa Creator Program, will bring together a global cohort of creators including artists, musicians, fashion designers and filmmakers the ability to build their businesses with NFTs.  There’s no “hard cap” on the number of creators for the first cohort and all members will have access to Visa clients and a broader network of mentors, Sheffield noted.  “Large merchants and brands are asking every day how they can get involved.” Sheffield said. “The thing that’s so exciting to us about NFTs is we think it lowers the barrier to entry for people to build a business and sell online.”  The traditional way of selling physical goods has a lot of logistics involved, which can be a huge challenge for small businesses and individuals to compete and scale. “NFTs allow someone who’s creative, who’s an artist, who’s talented, to produce a good entirely in a digital way,” Sheffield said.  Micah Johnson, a former Major League Baseball player and current artist behind Aku, was one of the first participants in the cohort. Visa previously announced the partnership in October 2021, but did not disclose that he was involved in the program at the time.�8�0

2022-03-31 03:32:11�tsqs2h�Rollbit stole $43,421 worth of ETH from me�"   On the 19th of November 9.5 ETH {$43,000) was stolen from me. It was done via what we now know to be a hijacking virus which was likely being used to watch what I was doing for the month prior.  I have evidence that shows it was installed by using a method of force downloading and installing a program, commonly referred to as ""drive-by hacking"" or a ""day zero hack"". It’s a form of targeted hack that requires no downloads from you, even cyber security experts I’ve hired are surprised by. The hackers laundered the money through Rollbit, a crypto gambling site on which I’d previously made YouTube videos and streamed on.  On the 25th of November, I contacted their support team. They offered me barely any information so I’m led to assume my money was gambled to a different account (owned by the hackers) via their roulette 1 on 1 gambling, and done with as they pleased.  This is Rollbit's responsibility as they have a policy on their site saying they require government ID for deposits of $2000+, which they did not have ([www.rollbit.com/aml](http://www.rollbit.com/aml)). They also must abide by report requirements, which they didn't but I’ll save that in case of a lawsuit. The AML policy stresses their safeguarding which is just a lie.  Despite efforts by law enforcement and I, Rollbit's support team is not offering me a refund for the deposits. They're trying every way to avoid paying me and it's actually disgusting. I make an effort in day-to-day life not to bring up my disability or complain about it because there's no real point and it makes it reasonable to expect less from myself, so I don't normally do it. But I'll make an exception; for a 20-year-old man in a wheelchair with a life-threatening disease, who can't walk, who is losing their speech, to in spite of all of that still have built up that amount, which is a lot of f\*\*\*ing money, is a big deal for me personally. For your support team to say that this is a ""disingenuous request to retrieve funds"" and mislead the police is absolutely sickening.  The fact is; your company allowed my money to be stolen, and you're not repaying me, take some responsibility.  The reason why I feel I deserve a refund is due to the fact Rollbit advertises their AML policy, which they for some reason didn't uphold which lead to my savings being stolen.  Update: it has been a month since I wrote the post above. After Rollbit support continuously told me that without law enforcement involvement they wouldn't help me. So I got the police involved back in January. Rollbit support since sent an email to Sussex Police saying this was a ""false claim"", so the police vouched and offered to show evidence.  That email was two months ago... Rollbit ghosted us and have been ignoring all further emails from both I and the police. So now I'm going to look for a lawyer to sue for it. Their actions have been disgusting and the lack of decency is inhumane.  If you are a lawyer and feel you would be able to represent me, please leave a comment.  I also want to say that Rollbit has broken the law, and did not ask for KYC, this is where the issue lies.  I’ll upload a youtube video on this ASAP, but I am disabled and my voice sounds like I'm high and drunk, thanks for reading.  The aim of this post is to spread awareness."�12�0

2022-04-01 19:58:57�ttzyl3�Turning 50€ of monthly spendings into a monthly crypto DCA with the Plutus Crypto Card�"**WHAT IS PLUTUS**  PLUTUS is a project on the Ethereum Blockchain that offers a non custodial platform with a crypto card. Due to its non custodial nature you run no risk of losing funds and are in full control of your holdings at all times, no lock ups and no trickery. You connect your account to Metamask and thats it, easy. I personally connected via Metamask with my Ledger.  **DUE DILLIGENCE**  Before i delve into the Rewards i thought a DD is of order. My opinion is very biased im a holder as well as a believer of this project.  ***MarketCap:*** The low market cap is a double edged sword. A project of this low MC has a high risk ratio but at the same time this means high reward once the project succeeds.  ***Long Term Survival:*** With rewards 2.0 PLUTUS as a project and company will be having a monthly revenue stream that is sustainable. The tokenomics of PLUTUS have been developed with the usecase in mind and a long term outlook.  ***Non Custodial:*** Hodl your PLU safely on your own wallet of choice. This also means that if the code of PLUTUS has a bug and is hackable your own funds are safe and the impact on the project will be minimised (price wise) as staking does not take place in a centralised manner.  ***Availability:*** The product (crypto card) is only available in Europe and the UK at the moment. During a recent AMA there were talks about expansions into South America next and the rest of the world.  ***User Interface:*** PLUTUS has both a desktop version and an App. I use both, but i find the desktop version a bit messy, as in you sometimes have to look quite some time to find something. On the app it is much simpler and the UI is improved.  ***REWARDS 2.0***  The new Rewards are a fantastic way to DCA money that you would otherwise just spend and never see again. Let me explain.  When utilizing this programme you get 20 perks to choose from:  10€ Rebate per month (or rebate in the base subscription fee) for any of the following :  &#x200B;  [The number of perks you can choose depends on the subscription you choose and whether you stake PLU or not.](https://preview.redd.it/ihw3wrei3zq81.png?width=2297&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a44eb4f00c28d94d23626d8fbba6afb1392fff0)  **Subscriptions**:   [3 Monthly subscriptions to choose from, this is mandatory](https://preview.redd.it/gcahuvyj3zq81.png?width=2023&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c400ff403d7a3f0caa6fe3a71b7f4461604aef)  With subscription alone you can reach the following maximum earnings per category:  **1)Starter,** 3% cashback on up to 250€/mo spend  so 7.5€ a month cashback & 1 perk of choice.  ***Max earnings 17.5€***  **2) Everyday,** 3% on up to 2000€/mo so 60€ a month cashback & 2 perks of choice.  ***Max earnings 80€***  **3) Premium,** 3% on up to 22,500€ so 675€ a month cashback. 3 perks of choice.  ***Max earning 750€***  &#x200B;  Furthermore we have **Staking requirements**, this is optional  [Note: the cashback &#37; from perks is not added to the subscription but it replaces the standard 3&#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/e0glr2am3zq81.png?width=2071&format=png&auto=webp&s=abf4dd145b01cd79643abd458413eef619dd692d)  So how do i make more than 50€ a month in cashbacks?  Currently im getting cashback from Netflix, my go to supermarkets Aldi and Lidl as well as justeats where i order food once or twice a month.  I havent changed my habits i simply added PLUTUS to my life, with an ""everyday"" subscription and the initial staking level called "" Hero"" .   Now i automatically DCA between  40€ a month due to the 4 perks and my cashbacks can go up to 80€ if i spend the full amount of 2000€  Certainly 50€ a month is retrieved from thin air per month and automatically invested.  Feel free to comment any questions or DM me if you need help!  Here are some links to start you of on DYOR:  [Official Website](https://plutus.it/)  [Platform](https://dex.plutus.it/), most likely you need an account to view the full UI  [Rewards 2.0 in detail](https://medium.com/plutus/announcement-rewards-accounts-2-0-model-details-e3738f9f6d3c)  [Card use fees (visa) and Dex fees](https://plutus.it/fees), the card fee has been removed and as for PLU withdrawal fees it will be reduced but was raised due to ETH gas prices."�11�0

2022-04-01 17:59:13�ttx55w�Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking? Staking is a popular way to earn passive income with your crypto investments. Here’s how you can start. GLTA!!!�By Krisztian Sandor, Coindesk  4/1/2022  Staking offers crypto holders a way of putting their digital assets to work and earning passive income without needing to sell them.  &#x200B;  [To date, I've earned 3.45 ETH. At 3.68&#37; APR, I will earn 0.01 ETH daily. GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/f2rzgdnuhyq81.jpg?width=1128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2c428a2a82582e15a1448195e09c80c0a74780b)  You can think of staking as the crypto equivalent of putting money in a high-yield savings account. When you deposit funds in a savings account, the bank takes that money and typically lends it out to others. In return for locking up that money with the bank, you receive a portion of the interest earned from lending – albeit a very very low portion.  Similarly, when you stake your digital assets, you lock up the coins in order to participate in running the blockchain and maintaining its security. In exchange for that, you earn rewards calculated in percentage yields. These returns are typically much higher than any interest rate offered by banks.  Staking has become a popular way to make a profit in crypto without trading coins. As of April 2022, the total value of cryptocurrencies staked exceeded the $280 billion threshold, according to Staking Rewards.  &#x200B;  [1-year All-ETH portfolio. Stack, Stake and HODL \(5 years minimum time horizon\) to Richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/0ij5oxuvhyq81.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=565d5fb1c0c5d1c938a200b4780857a2a3f5b331)  How does staking work?  Staking is only possible via the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is a specific method used by certain blockchains to select honest participants and verify new blocks of data being added to the network.  By forcing these network participants – known as validators or “stakers” – to purchase and lock away a certain amount of tokens, it makes it unattractive to act dishonestly in the network. If the blockchain was corrupted in any way through malicious activity, the native token associated with it would likely plummet in price, and the perpetrator(s) would stand to lose money.  The stake, then, is the validator’s “skin in the game” to ensure they act honestly and for the good of the network. In exchange for their commitment, validators receive rewards denominated in the native cryptocurrency. The bigger their stake, the higher chance they have to propose a new block and collect the rewards. After all, the more skin in the game, the more likely you are to be an honest participant.  The stake does not have to consist exclusively of one person’s coins. Most of the time, validators run a staking pool and raise funds from a group of token holders through delegation (acting on behalf of others) – lowering the barrier to entry for more users to participate in staking. Any holder can participate in the staking process by delegating their coins to stake pool operators who do all the heavy lifting involved with validating transactions on the blockchain.  6 Top Cryptocurrencies You Can Stake: An In-Depth Guide  To keep validators in check, they can be penalized if they commit minor breaches such as going offline for extended periods of time and can even be suspended from the consensus process and have their funds removed. The latter is known as “slashing” and, while rare, has happened across a number of blockchains, including Polkadot and Ethereum.  Every blockchain has its own set of rules for validators. For example, the Terra network capped the maximum number of validators at 130. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (formerly known as Ethereum 2.0) requires each validator to stake at least 32 ether, which is worth more than $100,000 at press time.  What cryptocurrencies you can stake  As mentioned already, staking is only possible with cryptocurrencies linked to blockchains that use the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  The most notable cryptocurrencies you can stake include:  Ethereum (ETH).  Cardano (ADA).  Solana (SOL).  Luna (LUNA).  Avalanche (AVAX).  Polkadot (DOT).  Ethereum is in a peculiar situation right now because it’s possible to both “mine” and “stake”.  The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently transitioning from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain system, meaning that both types of validation processes are functioning concurrently.  Eventually, however, ether mining will be completely phased out as the latter more energy-efficient system takes over.  How can you start staking  To begin staking you first have to own digital assets that can be staked. If you’ve already bought some, you’ll need to transfer the coins from the exchange or app you bought them on to an account that allows staking.  Most of the bigger crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken, offer staking opportunities in-house on their platform, which is a convenient way to put your coins to work.  If you are looking for a way to maximize rewards, there are platforms that specialize in finding the highest interest rates for your digital assets. Examples of these staking-as-a-service platforms include:  EverStake.  BlockDaemon.  Figment.  MyContainer.  It’s worth noting that any coins you delegate to a staking pool are still in your possession. You can always withdraw your staked assets, but there’s usually a waiting time (days or weeks) specific to each blockchain to do so.  It is also possible to become a validator and run your own staking pool. However, this needs much more attention, expertise and investment to do successfully. Not to mention, to become a validator on certain blockchains you’ll need to source sufficient funds from delegate stakers before you can even start.  Risks of staking crypto  As with every type of investing, especially in crypto, there are risks you need to consider.  Cryptocurrencies are volatile. Drops in price can easily outweigh the rewards you earn. Staking is optimal for those who plan to hold their asset for the long term regardless of the price swings.  Some coins require a minimum lock-up period while you cannot withdraw your assets from staking.  If you decide to withdraw your assets from a staking pool, there is a specific waiting period for each blockchain before getting your coins back.  There is a counterparty risk of the staking pool operator. If the validator doesn’t do its job properly and gets penalized, you might miss out on rewards  Staking pools can be hacked, resulting in a total loss of staked funds. And since the assets are not protected by insurance, it means there’s little to no hope of compensation.  How profitable is staking  Staking is a good option for investors interested in generating yields on their long-term investments and aren’t bothered about short-term fluctuations in price.  According to data, the average staking reward rate of the top 261 staked assets surpasses 11% annual yield. It’s important to note, though, that rewards can change over time.  Fees also affect rewards. Staking pools deduct fees from the rewards for their work, which affects overall percentage yields. This varies greatly from pool to pool, and blockchain to blockchain.  You can maximize rewards by choosing a staking pool with low commission fees and a promising track record of validating lots of blocks. The latter also minimizes the risk of the pool getting penalized or suspended from the validation process.  This article was originally published on Apr 1, 2022.�0�0

2022-04-01 16:34:00�ttv21p�A Guide on how to keep your crypto safe�Disclaimer- I am not a security expert or even a computer geek. The suggestions I am telling are purely something I personally use or have read about them. It is not an exhaustive list so please comment if I have left something.  1. Get a password manager- Even if your password is complex it is impossible to remember too many different complex passwords for all your accounts. It is always good to have different passwords for every account and a password manager does that. You have to just remember one password to unlock it.  **KeePassXC** it my pick.It is a free and open source password manager but the best think is it doesn't store your credentials online unlike most password managers. Another good option is **Bit Warden**.  2) Enable Two-Factor Authentication- This is a must and if you haven't done it for god's sake do it asap.There are some options but my favorite is- **Aegis**. **Authy** is also a good option. P.S if you are using Google Authenticator get a backup because when you will switch device it would be hard to restore the app.  3) Cold Wallet- You might be fed up by now by listening Not your keys not your coins but the reailty is most CEX are shady af. Also the peace of mind when you have your crypto in cold wallet is underrated.Get **Ledger** if you have a lot of Alts and **Tezor** if you just have BTC/ETH  Besides this always be aware of the sites you connect your cold/hot wallet and disconnect them after your usage. Also be aware of not sharing your portfolio information on social media platforms.�2�0

2022-04-01 13:55:09�ttr9j8�European lawmakers have voted to introduce new legislation designed to stop illicit flows amid industry pushback claiming the measures will stifle innovation and infringe on privacy.�  The proposal requires crypto service providers to collect information on senders and beneficiaries in all crypto transactions and must be made available to authorities upon request.  The mandate removes the minimum threshold for crypto transactions and applies to transfers involving private crypto wallets (unhosted wallets).  The EU plans to extend rules from traditional payments which obligates the validation of collected information for transactions over EUR 1,000 (US$1,107).  The proposal faced industry pushback, including from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who said the move “eviscerates all of the EU’s work to be a global leader in privacy law and policy.”  Global crypto markets fell roughly 2% by Friday morning Asia time, with Bitcoin falling 3.2%, according to CoinGecko data.�4�0

2022-04-02 19:32:03�tur4bl�Vitalik actually praises maxis, I hope this is an April’s fools joke�Apparently Vitalik mentioned that maxis are part of the main structure that upholds crypto, and I don’t think that’s 100% because we’re still in April 1.   Ethereum mastermind and co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a blog post Friday that, with compelling logic and detail, defended “Bitcoin maximalism.” The post seems largely serious, though its publication on April Fools’ Day introduces all sorts of questions about his real intentions.  The maximalist ethos broadly resists change to Bitcoin itself, while also arguing that more complex blockchain systems have inherent and inevitably fatal flaws. Buterin’s praise for maximalists is shocking because Ethereum itself is the most consistent and high-profile target of maximalist criticism, substantially because of the fragility introduced by the complexity of its smart contract features.  Nothing against people who prefer a certain coin over the rest, but I wouldn’t say being a maxi is a good thing. When you’re dogmatic for only one thing, you lose sight of pretty much everything else. And this is key. Imagine paying your full attention to BTC and ETH and missing out to the world of EGLD and its applications in the real world or what Exeno is doing to being crypto to life. You’d be in the wrong, and this is the real danger.   The object of life is not to find yourself lost between the masses but to avoid losing yourself in the ranks of the insane.   Go ahead and push your favored tokens, but never go as far to be a ‘maxi’. Do not lost sight of every else.�68�0

I can't tell you how many of these red days I've been through. I've literally seen ""bad"" news that eventually turns out to be good news, which brings the market down. At this point, it's just part of the crypto world for me and nothing to be worried about.  Can't wait to hear all the ""experts"" comment about how it is crypto Armageddon… laughable, really! The fact is that crypto is here to stay, and a slight 5% dip is nothing compared to a 15-20% jump. Ultimately, ETH and BTC will reach new ATHs in the near future. You can go ahead and quote me on that.  I'm going to take advantage of this lovely little sale and buy myself some more ETH. Besides, I'm also eyeing up good projects tethered to the NFT space like Quint (it offers limited-edition NFTs to the users of its Boutique NFT Marketplace), Decantraland (it has a full-blown virtual universe with in-world payments), and Enjin (it enables users to store virtual goods for games).  The point is, whatever you fancy, now is the time to buy it for a discount. The market may dip for one or two more days, so it works too if you are more of a DCA kind of investor.

Slated for Q2 2022, ethereum will switch to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work after the upgrade.  Vance Spencer explains why there’s so much excitement about ETH price and staking after “The Merge.”  &#x200B;  [To date, I have earned 3.46 ETH2 rewards from staking. I'm earning about 0.01 ETH2 per day based on current staking yield. Stack, Stake and HODL ETH to the richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/p1f92a2yp4r81.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=313d8d3ef64cc7b22a4c0d1d2f03e1a3f60294f3)  As a self-professed “gigantic ETH bull” who has been involved in the ethereum community since 2015, Vance Spencer could not be more excited about the upcoming ethereum merge.  The co-founder of Framework Ventures is not the only one who has been keeping his eyes peeled for any news and updates about the major network upgrade. People around the world are curious to find out more as search volumes for “ethereum merge” hit an all-time high last week, according to Google Trends data.  Framework Ventures  The growing interest in ethereum has come at a time when ether (ETH) charts a bullish upward trend. The second-largest cryptocurrency has surged 22.6% in the past two weeks to trade at $3,456, compared to bitcoin (BTC)’s 12.8% ascent during the same period, according to CoinGecko data.  Dubbed “The Merge,” the upgrade will officially see ethereum switch to the proof of stake consensus from the proof of work algorithm that powers bitcoin. Both mechanisms enable a distributed network of participants to verify blockchain transactions, but they differ in how they achieve consensus.  Proof of work requires miners to expend large amounts of computational resources and energy to add new transactions to the blockchain, but it is considered more secure. Proof of stake requires validators to stake cryptocurrency in order to organize transactions and create new blocks in the network. It is considered more energy-efficient and decentralized but may not be as secure as proof of work.  It’s happening for real this time  Although talks of the merge have circulated since as far back as 2015, the network upgrade has been delayed many times. This time, investor enthusiasm is palpable because there is “credibility” that it is actually going to happen in the second quarter of this year, according to Spencer.  “The merge was originally supposed to happen in 2016 and 2017, but there were just so many issues that ethereum had to work towards and build around to get to this point,” Spencer told Insider in an interview. “It’s more of a redemption or resurrection moment for ethereum in that it’s really executing on the long-term roadmap that it’s set out once upon a time.”  In August last year, the network successfully executed its London hard fork. Since then, more than two million ether tokens worth over $7 billion have been “burned,” which means that they have been removed from the total supply of ethereum, making the cryptocurrency “net deflationary,” he said.  More recently, ethereum merged on the Kiln testnet, the last testnet merge before the blockchain network’s long-awaited conversion to proof of stake.  The merge has boosted the demand for ethereum staking, which refers to the act of “locking up” your crypto holdings to help validate transactions on proof-of-stake blockchains in exchange for rewards in the form of tokens. Currently, more than 10 million ether tokens are staked via 320,810 validators, according to Copper Research.  What’s also breeding optimism for the merge this time is the emergence of the “fee market of ethereum,” in Spencer’s view.  “This fee market is worth billions a year to the people who are currently mining but will soon be staking to earn this,” he said. “That’s something that really wasn’t happening two or three years ago, there were really no fees on blockchains because we were not really users. But there are so many compelling user applications now that people are willing to pay for this and it’s just going to be a gigantic industry.”  Though to be sure, ethereum gas fees have become prohibitively expensive at times for users to conduct transactions on decentralized finance, non-fungible token, and metaverse platforms built on the blockchain.  Price action, staking yields, and other benefits  So what exactly will happen at the time of the merge? The transition has two phases, according to Spencer.  During the first phase, the network will turn off proof of work and turn on proof of stake. After that, ether holders will transact on the new proof-of-stake blockchain.  “What exists after that is the stakers are being paid in ethereum instead of the miners, it’s about 90% of a reduction in the supply that’s paid out daily,” he explained. “On the environmental side, it’s about 99% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and carbon emissions.”  Right after the initial merge, there will be two parts of ethereum too — the staked ethereum that’s locked up in the bridge and the ethereum that is still free-floating. Stakers cannot withdraw the staked ethereum until the old and new chains formally merge in the second phase, which is estimated for sometime in 2023.  “That’s a massive production supply that just cannot move,” he said. “I think that’s another reason why people are starting to pay attention around not only just the process technologically about building the network, but what it means for the underlying asset.”  As miners transition to holding onto their ether tokens to stake for staking rewards rather than immediately selling newly minted ETH tokens for profits, the supply will decrease substantially. At the same time, demand is likely to grow as institutional investors realize the profit potential in ethereum’s fee market.  Logically, the supply-and-demand imbalance could drive up both the price of ether and the post-merge staking yield of ethereum. Already, crypto analysts estimate that post-merge staking yields for ethereum could surge to between 7% to 15% from the current yield of below 5%. This is because transaction fees that are currently paid to miners will go towards stakers and validators instead, according to a research note from Genesis Trading.  “If annual percentage yields go up, it’s logical to think that there will be more capital that’s interested in capturing those, so there will be more ETH staked and locked up,” he said. “So you have this interesting potential for a runaway effect. I think that’s why people are excited about the price action.”  Despite the overall positive outlook on the merge, there is the potential risk of another delay — particularly for the second phase of the merge — that derails the bullish investment thesis for ether.  “The consensus in the industry is that the first part will happen in June, but the formal merge of the two networks is probably the least tied down of the two in terms of exact dates,” he said. “If that moves further out, it just means that there’s more ethereum that are on the other side of the bridge that can’t be pulled back over, so that would exacerbate any potential supply shortage.”�17�0

2022-04-02 11:11:38�tuggh2�The request for central banks for digital currencies will not bode well�There is no constitutional right guaranteeing that you can spend your money as you please. Although there should be, and there’s precedent for thinking that money is akin to speech and spending it (within the bounds of established law) a form of expression.  This particular problem has come to light as the U.S. government studies a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC). A digital dollar, as it is sometimes called, is essentially a way to make an internet-native version of cash and coins.  That’s quite dystopian for anyone who thinks there ought to be a measure of financial privacy – the same privacy afforded today by physical cash. Further, because CBDCs are mostly just research projects at this stage, they invite a high degree of skepticism and conspiracy theories.   Ever wonder how this will affect places like the Metaverse and the many projects within it like Suku world? Yeah well, me too. America wants a tighter grasp on the market, everything will be tracked and noted, and everyone will be chipped, this is the future they want.   “It shouldn’t be controversial to say that governments want insight and oversight over monetary flows. They enact policies that degrade privacy and set limits around how money can be spent; often in service of the noble aim of combating terrorist financing and money laundering.” Said Daniel Kuhn in a blog post.   Well, I beg to differ. You see, governments always look for that little thread, and they keep pulling on it till they rip your jacket apart.�26�0

2022-04-02 01:49:29�tu7gu9�OC Comedy Posts Contest with Donut Prize�"Hey, guys!  I have an idea and I want to share it with all of you. This idea was previously discussed with some MODs/users and was well received. So I'm going to post it here.  We have to encourage users to make OC posts. I'm thinking about a **weekly contest for the best OC meme** (Comedy flair post) with a donut prize. I will take care of the donut prizes. It could be 1000 donuts to the best Comedy post (Related to Eth) per week. 400 for second place and 100 for third one. One contest per week... The prize may increase in the future. I'm proposing a basic price to test if this dynamic works.   We can start with Comedy posts because they are the most common in the sub and it's easier to create memes. In the future, having introduced this strategy to create better quality posts, we can continue the contest with the others flairs. For instance: ""the best Media post, the best Technicals post, the best News post, the best Sentiment post, the best Adoption post"", etc.  The winner will not be chosen by a single person. It will be chosen by the users in the sub. Whoever has the most upvotes wins... Then, it can be verified by me and the mods to pick a winner.  **Important: All Comedy Posts are automatically participating**  The dynamic will start as soon as this is posted... Right now.  **Rules:**  -You can use templates from memes but adding something of your own, it can be a text inside the image or it can be an appropriate title, and according to the image and Ethereum.  -It can also be images designed or taken by the user.  -Videos are allowed. In this case it can be an edited video related to Eth or add a title that relates it to Eth (As a metaphor/analogy).  -Reposts are not allowed (A repost is understood as an image that is posted as it has been downloaded, with no modifications).  -The winner will be the one who gets the most upvotes in the post. Subsequently, the post will be verified to see if it fullfills the conditions, and later on, if the post is valid, the donuts will be awarded.  -If the post with the most upvotes doesn't fullfill the previous conditions or we notice some type of cheating, it will be disqualified and the user will be reported.  Despite having asked the MODs for permission, I'm implementing this dynamic on my own. Therefore, I will be aware of the details to avoid keeping the MODs busy with this so that they can continue doing their usual work.  If the dynamic works, we can apply it in the future a flair specifically for this (OC Comedy flair). This will take more effort on the part of the user (Of course this was also discussed with some MODs and users).  I'm creating this dynamic for fun and to improve the use of the Comedy flair. We don't need any changes to the system so I don't think we need a poll proposal.  It's something made by a community user for the sub. Thank you very much, everyone is welcome to participate!"�81�0

2022-04-03 17:59:34�tvfcfd�Returns on running a validator node vs. other investment projects?�"Running an Ethereum validator node seems like a pretty solid way to make low-risk returns. I believe this value is a ~4% compounding rate, though I am not sure on the specifics there or if that will change in the future.  Meanwhile, there are also many projects in the space that claim to give higher returns doing various other complex cryptocurrency trading, lending, automated investing, insurance, etc. I'd go as far as to say the majority of the Ethereum projects I see could be categorized as this. To name a few from different categories: [Compund](https://compound.finance/), [PieDAO](https://www.piedao.org/), [DerivaDex](https://derivadex.com/). But again it seems like there are *hundreds* of these projects. They projects have bold claims for returns, and go as far as to claim themselves as ""automated wealth creation"".  For our comparison, let's compare investments from a running an Ethereum validator node vs. some of the more successful projects. What do you think would have better long-term returns?  Lastly, can these methods be *combined*? Or does the 32 Eth required for a validator node need to be locked in with no way to use a collateral?"�4�0

The cybercriminals made away with $15.6 million worth of stolen cryptocurrency, CoinDesk reported.  According to the report, the attacker targeted the Anchor (ANC) money market, borrowing loans against negligible collateral after manipulating token prices to drive them down.  Third multimillion hack in a week  This has been the third multimillion dollar breach of a DeFi protocol reported in the past week, drawing attention to attackers’ increasingly sophisticated techniques. On Thursday another lending protocol, Ola Finance, lost $3.6 million. On Tuesday, more than $625 million was syphoned from Ronin network, a gaming-focused platform. This is scary.   I feel more crypto platforms like crypto exchanges, Coinbase and even crypto back platforms, Social Good need to incorporate more safety features so that they do not become targets for hackers like Inverse Finance.   The weak link was a price oracle  Inverse tracks token prices using a Keep3r oracle, which the attacker tricked into thinking that the price of Inverse’s native token was exorbitant, PeckShield reported. Then, they used the inflated INV as collateral to take out a multimillion dollar loan on Anchor.  A very clever attack  The attack was notably well-funded. The criminal or criminals first withdrew 901 ETH (approx. $3 million) from Tornado Cash, which is used to conceal traces of crypto distribution. Then, they deposited it into a few different trading pairs on SushiSwap, a decentralized exchange, inflating the price of INV as perceived by the Keep3r price oracle.  Then, they took to Anchor, using the sufficiently high INV price to take the loan out before it could be brought back down to normal levels.�72�0

2022-04-03 01:28:24�tuxjqy�The Will Smith Oscar Slap has become an NFT DAO�\[Reposted from NFT News Hub\] The [Oscar Slap DAO](https://opensea.io/collection/oscar-slap-dao) just launched as an NFT collection that commemorates the slap seen around the world. [Recreated in pastels, polygons and paint](https://opensea.io/collection/oscar-slap-dao), Will Smith's Oscars slap of Chris Rock on Sunday evening has inspired a frenzy of activity among cryptocurrency creators, who seem to have no qualms when it comes to parody.  According to Fortune, the NFT was minted less than a day after the incident at the Oscars and has hit a record value over its first 24 hours. An [Oscar Slap DAO NFT on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/oscar-slap-dao) was said to be ranging from $35 to $80. While Smith is still dealing with the backlash to his assault on Rock, which may include some kind of discipline from the Academy itself, Rock, who held his first comedy show last night in Boston, said he’s still processing the moment.  Of course, parodies in the form of NFTs are part and parcel of the blockchain world.

I was always wondering where/how Cryptos are made and now I know! You just select a supported Blockchain network (i.e Ethereum), build your Coin settings, and push the ""Launch"" button at the end.  They just charge a onetime fee and that's it! There's no royalties or anything else involved which is AWESOME!

2022-04-04 18:07:06�tw8p4h�There’s no escaping the trilemma. Scaling solutions will never go obsolete with Ethereum. Vitalik himself even stated that.�Back in 2021 when attending the Polygon ZK summit, Vitalik himself stressed on the importance of scaling solutions for the continuity of Ethereum.  No matter how better Ethereum becomes over the years, it will never escape the trilemma and the price it had to pay for security and decentralization in scalability.  This is why scaling solutions aren’t going anywhere unless someone finds a solution for the trilemma (which is very unlikely to happen soon).  But until then, we’re gonna have to focus on scaling solutions if we want to see Ethereum keep growing.  There are already some solid scaling solutions from AVAX to Zksync but I personally prefer Polygon for the simple reason that it basically has its hands on every possible scaling solution out there. Polygon PoS (commit chain), ⁠Polygon Miden (zkSTARK), Polygon Zero (recursive SNARK), Polygon Hermez (zkSNARK), Polygon Avail (Validium), Polygon Nightfall (Optimistic).  But no matter which scaling solution you love and support, rest assured that it wont be going obsolete anytime soon and is actually more than welcome to help Ethereum scale and development further.�1�0

2022-04-04 16:34:22�tw6eg2�Lido Staking�I would love to stake my ETH, however, I do not have 32 ETH. I know Ledger offers ETH staking using Lido, but in order for it to make sense financially to me, I would have to stack my entire stack (even though it’s not that big a stack). My concern is the reliability and how safe the Lido staking service is. If I stake my entire stack and something happens, I’ve lost all my ETH. Is Lido safe and would you stake all your ETH in it to get the returns? Or should I wait until it’s to been battle-tested and the bugs are worked out. I could also earn interest in DeFi too, but those are risky at the moment as well. Just looking for some opinions. I see the amount of ETH being staked on Lido now and it makes me feel more confident, but again, I don’t want to lose all my ETH so I’m very hesitant. What do you guys think?�1�0

2022-04-04 16:07:44�tw5r95�Ethereum network fees continue to climb again�While Ethereum network fees to transfer data dropped significantly in recent times, tapping a low of $5.98 per transaction in mid-March, gas fees are rising once again on the second-largest cryptocurrency network in terms of market valuation. On Sunday, April 3, we had the opportunity to see that the average transaction network fee is around 0.0056 ether or $19.58 per transfer.     Ever since I started working with ETH I use Metis for dealing with these types of ETH issues, gas fees, and transactions the most, but last month I was surprised cause we were able finally to cheaply move ETH without it costing a fortune in network fees. I wasn't sure of the exact date so I found on the internet that on March 12, 2022, Ethereum’s network fees dropped to a low of $5.98 per transaction after reaching a high on January 10, at $52 per transfer, interesting.     What are your thoughts on Ethereum network fees continuing to climb again after reaching a low last month?�7�0

2022-04-04 08:37:43�tvx2ov�Over 50% of Americans believe crypto will be the future of finance�According to a recent poll conducted by StarkWare, 53% of the participants see cryptocurrencies as the “future of finance.” Unsurprisingly, young people (between 25 and 34 years old) are more bullish on the matter, as 68% believe in this concept.  Crypto’s Integration Among Americans: The Latest Figures The blockchain-based entity – StarkWare – questioned 2,000 American adults of all ages to determine their viewpoint on the world of crypto and its future development. Per the results, 53% think the asset class represents the “future of finance.”  Among the 25 to 34 age group, this percentage is 68%, while among 35 to 44 year-olds, it is 61%, proving the theory that young people are much more discerning towards the industry than the older generations.  Additionally, 17% of the participants admitted they have invested in cryptocurrencies. The majority are constantly checking and adjusting their holdings. 82% said they have at least one crypto tracker on their phone, while 50% stated they “fiddle or amend” their possessions daily. Only 14% of the investors let a week pass without making changes.  Commenting on the matter was Eli Ben-Sasson – Co-Founder and President of StarkWare Industries:  “This poll shows how widespread crypto has become while indicating just how huge it will soon become. We see that young Americans, those who will soon shape the economy, are especially turned into crypto. It’s an important insight that they are investing in large numbers, and overwhelmingly convinced crypto will be “the future.””  The company commissioned the survey to mark the launch of its StarkNet platform. The latter aims to remove some obstacles when dealing with digital assets and build blockchain applications.�2�0

In my country the government announced 30% tax on crypto gains. Which is absurd ofc  For example I sold an NFT worth 1 ethereum and transfer from metamask wallet to my coinbase or wazir wallet which is linked to my bank account.  Would I have to pay 30% tax when I transfer from coinbase/wazir to my bank account?  What if I have a US bank account ( Aldera ) If I cash out to that account and send myself from that account to my country's account ... would that be taxable or be considered under gift tax?   Thanks and please feel free to clear my mistakes and confusion :D�5�0

2022-04-05 17:45:11�tx0m9m�Crypto adoption among celebrities at all time high, making the market worse but introducing new people�Not fair to say that celebrity adoption is a bad thing, but a common theme of it is that it was always misconstrued, and that it gave people the wrong image about crypto and what it does, or the meaning it should hold.   This is even more so the case in places like Indonesia and Malaysia. Celebrities and influencers in Indonesia seem to have become much more involved in Indonesia’s crypto investment industry since 2021. Many have become brand ambassadors for exchanges and crypto projects to help promote them and essentially raise the trading volume.  The participation of individuals such as Joe Taslim, an Indonesian actor that has gone global, and Indonesian models and actresses Jessica Iskandar and Shandy Aulia might not be surprising, considering celebrities’ inescapable presence in advertising and branding. Some celebrities have even created their own cryptocurrency. The trend of celebrity tokens has boomed, especially after one of the most prominent musicians in Indonesia, Anang Hermansyah, created his own token.  And despite the fact that celebrity adoption was somewhat helpful, it still was misleading to a number of users. Celebs, for example, did not venture within the field of DeFi tokens or DAOs or anything decentralized or on chains run by the people like the Lycan chain, but they instead always insisted in areas where they could maximize their profits, like NFTs.   The celebrity token trend in Indonesia is neutral as long as they comply with existing regulations, because for the past couple of years, there are lots of Indonesians that created their own cryptocurrencies. But what I think is important for Indonesian developers to understand is that their cryptocurrencies must have values for investors and users and must have something that differentiate them from other existing cryptocurrencies. This is because they have a responsibility to their investors and token holders.�52�0

2022-04-05 15:08:31�twx4o7�Reddit supports Ethereum-based NFTs�Ethereum ETH/USD is the second-largest token in terms of market capitalization. It has seen significant levels of growth, especially within DeFi and NFT spaces.     Be aware that people started to use search engines like LUDO or similar ones cause they function like Google for NFTs, we have plenty of NFTs on the ETH blockchain, they're the most popular ones so it's very hard to keep track of all these collections we have every single day.     This has led to it becoming the go-to blockchain for many platforms that want to adopt those technologies. Ethereum, prior to the ETH2 upgrade, still utilizes proof-of-work (PoW), where miners contribute computing power to verify the transactions.      One of the biggest social networks on a global scale, Reddit, has integrated Ethereum-based NFTs on the platform. Four NFTs were sold for up to $400,000 each to use as an avatar within the platform.      Do you believe this news will have an influence on value and is this a good time to buy ETH?�7�0

2022-04-06 23:12:47�txyz6g�Uniswap V3 Liquidity Mining: Exploring the Options�&#x200B;  Since at least 2019, Web3 projects have been incentivizing their communities to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. Liquidity is the lifeblood of any protocol and facilitating that liquidity in one way or another is a basic prerequisite for a successful project.  When Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap were the dominant DEXes, liquidity mining was relatively straightforward. All liquidity deposits on those exchanges are natively fungible, meaning that any deposit is directly comparable to any other one. Additionally, all liquidity deposits on those exchanges “cover” the full price range of the two assets in the pool, meaning that the AMM formula would serve up a price if token0 approached  an infinite value relative to token1 and, similarly, if token1  approached an infinite value relative to token0.  Uniswap V3 is now the dominant DEX, owing largely to its more expressive functionality. But with a richer feature-set comes greater complexity. One major casualty of Uniswap V3 is that liquidity mining now requires a profound technical expertise. Even launching an incentive on the full  price range — the most common approach to Uni V3 LM to date — still necessitates a degree of complexity.  Fear not, Web3-projects-looking-to-incentivize-Uniswap-V3-liquidity. A variety of teams are hard at work building solutions to simplify this process. Naturally, the team building xToken Terminal believes we’ve built the most secure, complete and powerful solution. However, we’ll still run through all the options that are out there in order to provide  you with the most complete set of information.  &#x200B;  [A basic summary of the feature sets for different Uniswap V3 liquidity mining options](https://preview.redd.it/mlof7idmqzr81.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=09bc06ac637d459b78e70425b6a8ac350fdf1017)  ## xToken Terminal  Terminal is our new capital markets platform, designed to provide DeFi/NFT projects — and whoever else! — seamless and permissionless access to fundamental on-chain primitives. The first of these primitives is Uniswap V3 liquidity mining. Via Terminal, a Web3 project can have a [Uni V3 LM program up and running in a few minutes](https://docs.xtokenterminal.io/terminal/mining/create-pool). No dev work or Uniswap expertise required.  Pool sponsors select a liquidity pool and price range to incentivize, one or more rewards token(s) to pay out to LPs and an optional vesting period on rewards. Once the liquidity/rewards pool is deployed, sponsors can initiate a rewards program for any amount over any period. Once a rewards program ends, sponsors can initialize a new one. Sponsors never need to leave the Terminal UI.  Similarly, LPs never need to leave the Terminal UI. LPs do not need to mint an NFT position (the sponsor mints a communal NFT on pool deployment) or navigate to alternative UIs to deposit liquidity pool tokens. Data on staked balances, APR, pool history, etc are all generated permissionlessly and viewable on the Terminal interface.  Terminal is available on L1, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1n35slirqzr81.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45f728c5ca017d9d37900b75fdb3e58e2f4ba93  ## Gelato (G-Uni)  Similarly to Terminal, Gelato also provides a fungible interface for a non-fungible Uniswap V3 liquidity position. While Gelato does not actively rebalance liquidity positioning, the protocol provides a  manager role on their contracts that allows a representative of a project to actively re-position if desired.  Gelato/G-Uni does not provide any infrastructure for staking rewards, rewards  vesting or rewards data. Projects using G-Uni tokens for liquidity  mining will need to deploy/configure smart contracts and build a custom frontend.  ## UniswapV3Staker  The UniswapV3Staker contract is the most “native” option available to projects looking to sponsor a liquidity mining program. The contract requires LPs to mint a Uni V3 NFT position and then deposit it. Rewards are paid out as a function of in-range liquidity, i.e. the more trading volume your position helps generate, the more rewards you will earn. This approach may be the most rooted in precision, but in practice it has been [marred by manipulation](https://medium.com/@revert_finance/onetickdao-eth-and-the-narrow-rangers-f9a376f7f0c9) as well as a bevy of UX challenges. It also requires deep Uniswap V3 knowledge to fully understand. Lastly, we’re not aware of a full-feature UI for projects that wish to use the UniswapV3Staker contract.  Some community members have proposed a few modifications to the contract — notably a change that requires LPs to cover a minimum price tick range. This change is likely to mitigate some or all of the issues related to manipulation of rewards, however, it is unlikely to allay any UX challenges.  ## Charm  Charm’s Alpha vaults rely on some of the most clever Uniswap V3 liquidity management logic that can be found in the space. Charm’s vaults rebalance in a way that avoids a direct swapping of assets, instead relying on single-sided pseudo-limit orders — a Uniswap V3 hallmark.  >Sidenote: many Uni V3 liquidity managers underestimate the slippage costs and gas costs of active rebalancing strategies, thus overestimating the expected value of a rebalance. Maximizing capital efficiency at a given moment does not necessarily lead to maximization of value.  Charm is soon to release a permissionless version of their vaults (Alpha  Pro). It remains to be seen whether their approach, which is well-tested and successful on high liquidity pairs like ETH<>USDC, will be performant — programmatically or otherwise — on long tail pools.  At launch, Alpha Pro will not offer the smart contract or user interface architecture for native liquidity mining.  ## Gamma  Gamma pursues a more active rebalancing strategy, relying at least partially on off-chain logic that is not transparent to LPs. Though decentralization advocates may protest, there may be something to be  said for this more obscured approach, as purely on-chain rebalance strategies may be vulnerable to front-running or other forms of value extraction. Gamma is in the midst of remodeling their approach to liquidity management, so some elements of this description may no longer be accurate.  Gamma pools are not permissionless and there is no native liquidity mining architecture.  # A Note on Rebalancing  We at xToken have been demo-ing our new platform for a variety of projects in the space. We’ve been excited by the positive feedback we’ve received on the platform’s ease-of-use, configurability and  extensibility.  Several projects have asked us why we don’t offer the ability to rebalance  positioning in a pool. As the product currently operates, pool sponsors must set a price range at deployment and are unable to modify that price range (although deploying a new pool with new price range takes only a few minutes). While we are exploring methods of introducing this functionality, we believe that offering a rebalance feature on a permissionless platform like ours could expose our users to frontrunning and other forms of value extraction.  Why is that? We have experience with Uni V3 repositioning from our time managing [xU3LP](https://medium.com/xtoken/introducing-xu3lp-fungible-yield-f151c747131b), which for several months, was the largest provider of managed Uniswap V3 liquidity. It turns out that rebalancing must be executed very carefully, especially when the position in question is responsible for the lion’s share of liquidity on the Uniswap pair (this concentration of pool ownership is likely the case for many LM programs). In carefully researching management strategies for xU3LP, we witnessed many instances of LP rebalances being front-run by bots on-chain. In short, rebalancing large Uniswap V3 positions requires a level of expertise and sophistication uncommon in the space.  # Get in Touch  Interested in learning more about xToken Terminal?

Im hearing quite a bit about future ETH valuations reaching as much as 60k. I guess my question is: a) The “merge” is inevitable right?! b) When that happens will ETH still be a store of value?

I've got some NFTs deployed on Rinkeby and I've sent them to a couple different wallets. My plan is I'll then distribute the seedphrases to each person, they can each install a wallet, put the seedphrase in, and off they go.  All the wallet softwares I've tried, however, either don't actually display the NFT or it's extremely clunky to do so. Metamask Mobile is the only one I've actually gotten my NFT displayed in, but only after importing the custom token. The UX of this process is ... not great for layperson, and I think most will lose interest if they have to go this far.  Are there wallets out there that will display NFTs just out of the box? Why is this functionality not default everywhere by now?"�1�0

2022-04-06 12:10:59�txkpt2�Reddit has incorporated Ethereum based NFTs within its platform.�Reddit, one of the biggest social network in the world, has incorporated ethereum based NFTs within its platform.  Four NFTs (pictured above) were sold for as much as $400,000 each to use as an avatar within the Reddit platform.  You can’t use your own NFT as an avatar. If you don’t have one of the four, you’ll have to just use a given jpeg.  The extremely limited NFTs available suggests this is probably just an initial test to see how integrating NFTs might work on Reddit.  This can easily be expanded by allowing people to mint their own avatar NFTs, either as a sale or just as a function.  Or you can use any NFT you have after connecting with Metamask as required by the platform.  Their function is then to just display them on your profile page which they might be trying to make more prominent in the new Reddit design.  It could also be just a way to get people to switch from the old Reddit design, which still remains very popular, to the new one.  Twitter has also tried to integrate NFTs as a profile picture, with it not too clear how that went as we haven’t come across many of them in the wild here at Trustnodes.  There are privacy concerns, especially if the user’s ethereum address is shown as Twitter does, because then you can potentially see someone’s wealth and their financial activity.  At scale, this can all be graphed to de-pseudonymize blockchain addresses, requiring significant care in execution to not basically open source your bank account.  A problem that OpenSea doesn’t have because the blockchain address is the username and the account.  Reddit and Twitter can also allow for blockchain accounts, with the user then giving it a nickname if they want, unless they’re comfortable with attaching their ethereum address to their real name.�3�0

2022-04-06 12:08:32�txkoai�CEO says that Starbucks will enter the metaverse business in 2022.�On April 4, the billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, announced in an Open Forum that the company is planning to enter the NFT business before the end of 2022. This news was confirmed by the company itself a few hours later.  Although Schultz did not provide an exact date as to when the company would move into the NFT world, he assured that it would be “sometime before the end of this calendar year.”  Starbucks to enter the world of NFTs before the end of 2022 During his speech, Schultz asked the audience how many had heard about NFTs. He also inquired as to how many of them had been involved in NFTs or participated in NFT investments. Even though the room fell practically silent, Schultz explained that the ecosystem was young and that Starbucks had the best tools and collections to move into this new ecosystem.  “If you look at the companies, the brands, the celebrities, the influencers that are trying to create a digital NFT platform and business, I can’t find one of them that has the treasure trove of assets that Starbucks has from collectibles to the entire heritage of the company.”  Schultz’s new appointment as CEO of the company could bring an even more crypto-friendly Starbucks. It is important to note that other mainstream companies are not only sponsoring NFT drops but also creating new crypto experiences like stores in the metaverse or collaborations with other crypto projects.�0�0

2022-04-06 11:42:25�txk7ju�What do you think is causing the drop of ETH gas fees?�High gas fees were previously the most difficult obstacle for investors using the Ethereum network; we had to use all of these solutions, whether L2 like Metis or Loopering, or others. Ethereum, on the other hand, has experienced a continuous fall in its gas fees, which have dropped by 90% in the previous six months and many of us feel relieved.  According to the crypto data intelligence platform, Santiment, the average gas fee on the Ethereum network is currently $5.81, 90% less than what was charged in November 2021. According to Etherscan.io, gas fees are currently as low as $3.17.  Just remember that last year on November 8, 2021, the average a user paid for a transaction was $62.85. In May 2021, gas fees hit their highest price of $69.In the last few months, I've begun exploring a lot more new marketplaces than I used to. Now, every month, I discover and use a new place, for example, last month, it was nOFTEN or SK8coin. As a result, it is not surprising that many analysts connect the increase in Ethereum gas fees in 2021 to an increase in the sales of NFTs on the Ethereum network.  Do you think that the migration of Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus model and the rise in popularity of layer 2 protocols are some of the reasons for the decline in gas fees?�8�0

2022-04-07 15:33:55�tyfnw4�Did you know that the average 7-day fees paid to the Ethereum protocol are about 40 times higher than those paid to Bitcoin?�"Today I read the news about how the average 7-day fees paid to Ethereum protocol are almost 40x higher than Bitcoin’s.     ""As a matter of fact, Ethereum’s seven-day average fees on April 5 amounted to $24,487,397, which is 39.29 times or 190.1% more than $623,285 – the seven-day fee average of Bitcoin."" This really did not surprise me since all of us are using so many gas fee solutions, such as Metis or any other L2 solution, we're lucky that now we have so much choice cause there are a lot of them.     Ethereum’s transaction fees are at their lowest levels for more than eight months, currently sitting at $5.81. In contrast, the average gas fee on November 8, 2021, stood at $62.85.     Do you recall how analysts linked an increase in Ethereum gas fees in 2021 to an increase in NFT sales on the Ethereum network? This is not surprising given that we have new marketplaces every month, whether it's SK8coin or some NFT-powered game like K4 Rally, or popular ones like Axie Infinity, or any other cause this might truly have an influence on high gas fees.     Even the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin himself has admitted this. Indeed, the network’s high fees have long presented a major challenge to its usability and a threat to the vision of creating a decentralized economy."�15�0

2022-04-07 09:52:02�ty9jbh�We usually think ETH2.0 is taking forever, but ETH has only been around for 6 years.�This might sounds like a long time, but precise and careful development and planning takes time.  There’s also the fact that Ethereum’s scalability issues didn’t show its true magnitude up until the beginning of 2020 around the time where L2s started gaining popularity.  Don’t expect “ETH2.0” to be completed right away. Things like this take time. Even Vitalik described it as a process and that up until then, Ethereum will focus mostly on ZK rollups and sharding.  This is why I’m guess Vitalik has been a fan of Polygon for the longest. They’re technically the best out there when it comes to ZK tech with $1 billion allocated just for ZK development purposes. They currently have the largest number of ZK solutions from SNARKs and STARKs.  So don’t get too impatient. ETH2.0 is more of journey that has a patches, fixes and improvements all along the way. So relax and enjoy these improvements one by one.�15�0

2022-04-07 01:43:25�ty1vp1�Is there any good reason at all to still have funds on CeFi if you know better DeFi opportunities?�Before I discovered DeFi, I was using CeFi.  Things like blockfi and celsius.  Back when I first learned about these, I thought they were game changers. 5-6% on bitcoin paid weekly? Yes please!!  That is, until you learn about DeFi. Easy 20-30% returns. Even opportunities that can yield 50-100%, even more than that like 300% even.  With that being said, is there any reason to still keep some funds on CeFi? Or should everything just be moved to DeFi?  With DeFi, it is decentralized. You can control your funds through a hardware wallet. And you can get percentages much more lucrative than 5%.   What do you guys think? Why keep funds on cefi?�0�0

On Coinbase, they convert your ETH to ETH2. And both these platforms payout in ETH2. Is that all just gone/worthless now? Or is this mostly semantics, and the name is what’s cancelled?  Platforms (at least the ones I’m using) have not addressed this announcement yet in any official capacity, so I thought I’d ask those with potentially more knowledge than I have.�3�0

Extensive research about a blockchain project takes time and is very frustrating, leading people to take impulsive decisions based on emotions. As we are all living in the era of Tiktok and other instant content, taking the time and having the effort to research becomes a rarity among investors.

I am conducting the following research to understand better problems that people have while investing or learning about crypto or blockchain. As you know, researching crypto projects is quite a hard task, and a lot of people don't have the time and skills necessary to do this task. This is why I started a project that aims to help people do better and easier research. At the moment, we try to find the biggest pain that people have while learning, researching, or investing in the blockchain ecosystem.

2022-04-08 04:07:55�tyv07a�NFT games that you think are worthwhile?� Since P2E games began to appear, I've been eager to see and play rally games, which I've always enjoyed ever since I was a child. I’m new to NFTs and I really want to play rally games since that’s what I love playing. But the thing is, I don’t think there are a lot of NFT rally games or I’m just not looking hard enough? Lol. At the moment, I’m looking into these two:   [Revv Racing](https://www.revvracing.com/): first blockchain-based racing game. I’m actually still thinking about this since I think I’m already too late to get a pretty good car at a decent price? Anyways, I have watched other people’s gameplay on YT and it’s good enough for me even though it’s not a rally game. They have a weekly racing challenge/event which is cool. I also love their car designs.    [K4 Rally:](https://k4rally.io/) first blockchain-based rally game. Compared to Revv, I’m much early on this. They still haven’t launched the game yet and haven’t dropped their NFTs yet. They will also have a beta test this April and I hope I can be one of the testers so that I can know whether I will push through with this. I like their idea of NFT rentals for an additional profit for the owner. Also, real rally champions are part of their team to make better gameplay for the users.  Looks like they want to unite the motorsport and the blockchain community. What do you guys think about that??    There’s also this game called [sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) that’s not a rally/racing game but I’m kinda interested in it since they said will be kinda similar to Minecraft which I enjoy playing too! I heard it from a friend and I haven’t really done a lot of research yet lol.    Lastly, What do you guys think about [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)? I want to try it but their website keeps crashing or just keeps loading when I’m still customizing my character. Maybe it’s better if it’s like sims where you need to download it and not just play it on a browser? It looks pretty fun though since you can do a lot of things on the game.   I don't think I have a lot of options, so I'm open to playing different kinds of games, not just rally games, so if you could recommend me more P2E games, I'd be grateful.�115�0

But i also know that i invested in sol when it was $78 being very confident that it would go back to over $100 short term. I ended up being correct but i only put like 7% of my portfolio into sol because i figured i’d limit my risk. This is all good because it can just as easily go down as it can up. But it’s hard seeing your small investment double when your portfolio as a whole doesn’t change too much. Why not just buy the alt coins if you’re confident and get much greater returns? this is a struggle for me�2�0

2022-04-09 19:58:13�u00ywy�Some people consider DeFi staking high risk and I don’t really know why�DeFi staking allows you to gain free crypto, making it an easy way to earn a passive income. However, as with any other investment, there are risks involved. Why is DeFi staking considered high risk?  DeFi staking is high risk due to the holding period and volatility. Even if you earn a decent amount of interest on your stakings, the price could plummet at any moment, causing you to lose money. It can also take a few days to unstake your crypto and rewards, meaning you can’t sell right away.    In most cases, you'll have to lock up your crypto for up to a month when you first begin staking. If you plan on holding your crypto for a long time, this won't be a problem for you. But if you plan on selling when prices start plummeting, this may be an issue.  Fees. Staking has fees. Try to find the one with the lowest costs.  You could lose all your rewards. You might make a decent amount of passive crypto from staking. However, prices could drop overnight, and all your rewards may be gone. You could even lose money if this happens. Always keep this in mindbefore deciding to stake your crypto.  Unstaking. You may want to sell your crypto as quickly as possible if the price is high and you fear it'll begin to plummet. In many cases, you have to wait a few days before you can withdraw your crypto from the stake pool, so this could cause you to lose potential earnings.  Useless stake pool. You may have chosen a bad or small stake pool and realize you're not making any extra crypto. It takes time and effort to stake your crypto in the first place, so unstaking it and staking it again in a different stake pool is even.   Despite all of these there are still many projects on the market that change the tone of this argument. Projects like Lycan right now has incorporated DeFi staking well despite being relatively new, and so has even brands like Binance and many others, trying their best to solve these problems aforementioned.   There are also many advantages to DeFi staking.   Earn rewards. The main reason people choose to stake their crypto is to earn more crypto. It's an incentive for people to actively participate in the blockchain and a great way to get involved.  It's generally straightforward. The easiest way to stake your crypto is by using a stake pool, which an operator runs. This way, you don't have to worry about becoming a node or doing anything complicated. All you need to do is choose a stake pool, add your crypto, and you're done.  Eco-friendly. In general, staking is more eco-friendly than the proof of work mechanism, which Bitcoin and Ethereum currently use. However, Ethereum is currently switching from a proof of work to a proof of stake mechanism, so you can�38�0

2022-04-10 22:51:07�u0t79o�OBFC - A new mechanism for wire transfers on Ethereum�For visibility, we are posting here on r/ethtrader . Hopefully, the community here will find this interesting.  **Background**  Decentralized exchanges and lending protocols have given people a reason to manage their own assets and interact with them through decentralized systems. A few years ago, decentralized systems provided a worse, and less desirable experience than centralized systems, but today decentralized anything is the preferable way to exchange, lend, trade and do about anything else in crypto. This is primarily due to the massive benefit of user-controlled accounts, real-time settlement, and extensibility of decentralized systems. The ability to “off-ramp” digital assets to fiat currency, directly, using cryptographic transactions makes holding digital assets with keys you control massively more useful and valuable.  The problem with holding your money on a decentralized ledger is sending money to the non-blockchain world is impossible without connecting to a centralized fiat service. Each centralized fiat system works within a specific national border and has a hard time dealing with international transactions.  **Introducing Web3 Fiat Currency Transfers**  OBFC provides a standard protocol to perform a SWIFT/Fed based wire transfer using assets on Ethereum, by simply interacting with a smart-contract, rather than a traditional custodian or escrow service. No more passwords, phone verifications or emails, OBFC requires only one authorized on-chain transaction to initiate real-time wire transfers to bank accounts almost anywhere in the world.  The protocol enables programmable electronic bank transfers on Ethereum. Performing an international wire transfer is as easy as transacting with the OBFC smart-contracts. Simply embed the OBFC wire transfer service right into your smart-contract and decentralized finance application and start moving fiat currency without touching a bank. The protocol makes doing “real world” currency transfers possible without leaving the digital world of Ethereum and other blockchains. The total process of initiating an electronic funds transfer and receiving receipt takes place entirely on-chain in one single transaction.  **About**  The official interface to the protocol can be found here:  [https://obfc.finance/transmit](https://obfc.finance/transmit)  The forum is here:  [https://forum.obfc.finance/](https://forum.obfc.finance/)  The discord is here:  [https://discord.com/invite/nsCcg353Nx](https://discord.com/invite/nsCcg353Nx)  The sub reddit is here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OBFC/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OBFC/)  **What we want**  We want your feedback, questions and comments.  Thank you,  Team OBFC�1�0

2022-04-10 20:48:38�u0qoab�Ethereum’s Russian-born cofounder has been quietly supporting a DAO that raised $8 million in crypto for Ukraine. His dad is even more involved�"Alona Shevchenko was terrified when she learnt that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his army were planning to invade Ukraine.   Shevchenko, 28, a Ukrainian living in the United Kingdom with family in Ukraine, first learned of the impending invasion on Jan. 19 from a buddy with contacts to Ukrainian intelligence services, according to Fortune.   ""I had a really difficult time in the weeks leading up to the invasion and had a big mental breakdown,"" Shevchenko said, ""knowing that the invasion was about to happen and the public was mostly blind to that.""    She protested for weeks in front of the Russian embassy in London. She wrote a blog entry about the war in the United Kingdom on February 21.  But Shevchenko isn’t just anyone. She's a key member of a lot of well-known DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, in the crypto industry, and she has friends who are as well.   Shevchenko and two pals from Pleasr DAO, which collects art, held a group chat the same day she published her blog post to discuss the possibility of forming a DAO dedicated to raising funds for Ukraine.   A DAO is a blockchain-based community that isn't administered by a single person or entity in theory. Instead, the DAO's rules and governance are written in smart contracts and cannot be changed unless the DAO's members choose to do so. Each DAO has its own set of objectives and missions. Consider it a group chat among pals. Other DAOs making waves are Crayon Dao which has his own token on $Cray on platforms like Binance has many subbranches, Steam, Ughur and Uniswap.  Shevchenko's three-person group chat swiftly grew into the Ukraine DAO, which drew thousands of members to its Discord, a popular crypto-community messaging platform. The Ukraine DAO raised almost $8 million in less than a month for organizations and individuals assisting Ukrainians affected by the conflict. Along the process, some well-known members of the crypto world got engaged, including Vitalik Buterin, the Russian-born co-founder of the blockchain that powers Ethereum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency, and Buterin's father, Dmitry."�120�0

Yes it is highly profitable, yes small projects within it like suku are making it even more profitable and powerful, but are you able to make that profit.   If you are, then good on you. As for me, I’m still confused about some things and I’ve yet to understand how it’s done exactly. I’ve had a lot of friends who have jumped the Metaverse shark and made so much, but that is something I have to research on my own.   For the moment, keep focusing on eth. Now that eth 2.0 is to be rolled out officially, there’s more hype than ever.  Know that before summer, we will see massive booms in Ethereum prices, especially after that.   I’m not listening to what the ‘experts’ have to say any more, I know one thing, eth is going up, and that’s for sure. I’ll keep buying, once per week.   There are a lot of projects in the markets of today, but keep your eyes fixed on the target you started with, once you’re confident enough to make another, then join them too.�58�0
2022-04-10 17:35:51�u0mkjh�Ethereum Scarcity GOES UP! Net Daily Issuance Hits a 2-Month Low!�"As per the data analytic firm IntoTheBlock, the net daily issuance in the Ethereum (ETH) network has been dropping steadily, implying a supply deficit.  ""ETH net daily issuance is dropping. After reaching a top on March 12 of 3.48%, the 7-day average net issuance has been around 2.21%. ETH has not had a negative net issuance day since January 10, but it reached a 2-month low on Tuesday of 0.87%,"" the firm pointed out.  A slip in Ethereum's net daily issuance is bullish because it represents scarcity in the network. ETH's demand is expected to push up, increasing the price-value of the asset.  And flourishing conditions for ETH usually translate into a booming interest in the NFT ecosystem. Projects linked to the NFT space that have practical use cases like Plastiks (which bridges the gap between plastic production and recovery, by driving accountability and traceability); Theta (a project that provides decentralized video streaming for the Metaverse); and Axie Infinity (an NFT-based online play-to-earn video game), could see massive rallies triggered by ETH supply deficit.  Ethereum issuance is the difference between mined Ether and those burned after being used in transactions. Therefore, it entails the available Ether on the network. The lower the available Ether, the greater the demand, and hence, the higher the price!"�81�0

2022-04-10 16:58:53�u0ls8l�Unpopular opinion: AMMs are NOT the future of DeFi and will be replaced with order books�TLDR: Without subsidies, AMMs lack the necessary  incentives to for both traders and liquidity providers. \*Stablecoin AMMs are an exception  The success of an exchange is defined by 1) depth of liquidity and 2) the cost of trading to the end-user.   Traditional order-book exchanges are superior to AMMs in both regards as 1) AMMs fail to sustainably attract liquidity and 2) users of AMMs face a higher-cost of trading.

2022-04-11 18:49:14�u1ellr�Should we be concerned about crypto currency adoption's negative environmental impact, or should we seek out more efficient alternatives to widely used coins like Ethereum and bitcoin?� Some blockchain projects aren't merely marketing ploys; they have a real purpose that many people are unaware of.  More crypto projects are using social media to build strong communities, as having a strong community behind you will never let you down, and it will also help to raise awareness about the project. As more people use coins, new initiatives that are more efficient than previous ones will emerge. Finance, healthcare, and management are among the industries where cryptocurrency is gaining traction. In the field of finance-based crypto currencies, Aave, Fantom, and Pancake Swap are all great innovations.   Maybe it's because I'm enamoured with well-known businesses that promote meme currencies. The market, in my opinion, has reached saturation. And you should have bought some valuable coins early on in the bull market to profit from it while avoiding the bear market. Ripple is one of my favourite cryptocurrencies because it uses a consensus architecture to keep itself secure, requiring each transaction to be approved by a group of trusted validators.  Ripple started with 100 billion coins and will gradually distribute them to the market, removing the need to mine new currency. This is a common blunder that can only be avoided by conducting thorough project research. There are already projects on the market that promote environmentally friendly products, such as the one-of-a-kind Nano, algorand, and Bob Eco Coin.   While some cryptocurrencies are designed to address real-world issues, others, such as doge and shiba (meme coins), have a large market and are still being purchased. If this trend continues, the crypto community should be concerned because actual adoption is being suffocated.  What are your thoughts on the environmental issue?�38�0

2022-04-11 17:30:32�u1d1ps�No the Ukraine war is not making crypto more desirable�I hate that I keep seeing people make this claim and stand by it. Even if it was so the case, this is no place to defend a war because it makes your eth more sellable and it makes your NFTs cheaper to buy… What is wrong with people?   The political and humanitarian crisis in Europe provoked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine created a massive tide of emigration from both countries. For many migrants and refugees, crypto has become the only tangible way to take their savings with them. However, that hasn't brought any notable boost to the crypto market, research shows.  It’s been studied and well documented, that the war was not good for crypto like most people would like to think. The hot wallets of the major cryptocurrency exchanges working with the Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia, inluding peer-to-peer marketplaces like LocalBitcoins and Paxful, and found no significant fluctuations related to the war and migration.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine created a crisis both outside and inside Russia's borders. While Ukrainians are leaving their destroyed homes for Poland and other European countries, Russians are hitting the road to escape persecution for their anti-war stance, as Russia introduced draconian censorship, criminalizing any public speech about the war that deviates from the official position.  Nothing good comes of war, stop trying to make it sound like it was good for you to make a couple of buys. If you really want to buy something on the rise, try investing in something that is prospected to be part of the future like the Metaverse or the many projects within it like Suku instead of complaining on the Internet. I even saw this one guy complaining that lack of updates in the war is slowing down crypto this week.   I don’t even know what to say. Maybe the Covid lockdown has caused us to lose some sense of morality, because this is no way to talk about a war where people are dying.�16�0

2022-04-11 06:42:41�u11ezr�What are your experiences with play-to-earn crypto games?�   First of all, these P2E (play to earn) games payout mostly in crypto. Which requires appreciation to realize any actual gains. Playing to earn money will have a significant impact on the world. That is without a question. Playing games allows anyone to make money from anywhere on the planet. It's entertaining while also providing a financial benefit. It is possible to play from the comfort of your own home. Web3 is obviously the future of the digital world. And just like our current Web2, Web3 will need gaming to thrive. It's not the most important thing for Web3 but it will be necessary for Web3 to be better than Web2. I am tryna explore different ways to play and earn with crypto games at the moment now that I am just home and I have no job yet. What would you guys recommend and what are your experiences?�118�0

I know there’s reason to be afraid, but this amount of panic is unjustified. Yes, crypto is crashing, but I mean, most of us here have been through much, much worse, so why would you be afraid?   Truth is, crypto has always been highly affected by world news. News change the price this is a fact. And the reality is that there is a lot of turmoil and negative news around the markets that there isn’t anything to keep the prices up.   The only sector still going up today is the Metaverse and everything related to it, and yeah maybe that’s a statement of their strength, but maybe because the world is evolving. I mean we’ve already seen so many brands like McLaren partnered with infintite by suku to enter the Metaverse along with Gucci and Roblox, and I’m starting to see a pattern here. The mass corporations of the world believe in the Metaverse and this is fact.   For the rest of us, might be best to just hold and wait, as we have done, and as we should do. In the meantime maybe start researching other projects and other names that perk your interest.   Things will recover, but it will take time.�75�0

The Ethereum network is often referred to as the Web3 foundation layer, despite the fact that its native currency, ETH, has no defined definition.       The second-largest blockchain, Ethereum, has gone a long way since its beginnings, and it is extremely essential since it drives nearly all of the NFT ecosystem. To keep up with all of these new collections, we'll need to employ LUDO or similar NFT search engines that look like Google.  I admire how David Hoffman, co-host of Bankless, tried to explain ETH in terms of the present monetary system.When ETH is staked, he claims, it becomes a capital asset since it generates revenue and can thus be valued based on expected returns, much like bonds.  When ETH is used as a transaction payment mechanism, it functions as a consumable asset, similar to how US dollars are used to pay taxes. Finally, holders can use ETH as a store of wealth by depositing it into DeFi protocols  .The Ethereum ecosystem is built on this definition. It demonstrates the multiple factors that influence the price of ETH while also paving the door for wider adoption and growth. It also shows how ETH may be compared to important assets in traditional economies. The Ethereum ecosystem, for example, can recognize the US economy's trinity of US currencies, US government bonds, and IRS taxes.  So, what are your thoughts on Ethereum, and what is your definition of it?"�8�0

2022-04-12 14:51:49�u20x0y�Do you believe that everything they're intending to do with the merging will be as beneficial as they claim?�"Have you heard the news, that Ethereum just ran a major ‘merge’ test, bringing it one step closer to a game-changing upgrade?      On Monday, developers began a test for that upgrade, reporting that it went well, although it had some “minor issues.”    Many of us have been waiting for this moment and I was really interested in how all this will go and whether it will really justify the expectations of users.     The test was a dress rehearsal for what’s called the “merge,” which aims to dramatically shift how transactions are validated on the blockchain.  We're all using platforms like Metis without which it would be unthinkable for us to use ETH and have faster and cheaper transactions, so it's no surprise why so many people are curious about this merge which as they say would ensure that the transition is smooth for all ETH holders and users.     As I find out online, the next test is set for April 22, so I hope that we will have then more answers to our questions.   ""The main point of the merge is switching from a proof-of-work model to a proof-of-stake model. With the planned upgrade to proof of stake, users would be able to validate transactions according to how many coins they contribute, or stake, to the network. In return for staking more coins, users have a higher likelihood of being chosen to validate transactions on the network and earn a reward."" as one article explains it.     Do you believe that everything they're intending to do with the merging will be as beneficial as they claim?"�10�0

2022-04-12 13:33:30�u1z8av�Ethereum's Shadow Fork�The first mainnet shadow fork for Ethereum went live Monday, signifying a critical achievement for the popular cryptocurrency.  Background: Ethereum’s network follows a proof-of-work (PoW) system, which can be a manual way of verifying a user. The network is now switching to proof-of-stake (PoS), which can be faster and more energy-efficient.  Details: A shadow fork basically is a critical point in this migration where data can now be shared on both chains. Basically, it is huge news for Ethereum developers and traders.  History: Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, has been pegged by some experts to overtake Bitcoin in 2022. Obviously, that hasn’t happened yet.  Numbers: Despite the shadow fork on Monday, the price of Ethereum fell about 6%. However, most cryptos had a bad Monday as well, which has been attributed to rising interest rates.  Final Thoughts: At this point, Ethereum is still down for the year.  Hope you enjoyed this commentary.

2022-04-12 04:29:31�u1qij2�Recap on my jump into crypto with results. Spoiler - it’s not pretty.�Some time ago I posted my thoughts on several projects I was interested in. This was in r/cryptocurrency and at the time I wasn’t holding much ETH.   [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qo7pmh/long_if_you_had_to_pick_3_to_prioritize_over_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  My thesis was that if I invested in 10 projects and 7 of them fully zeroed out, 100% loss, that at least 1 of the remaining 3 would be a 10x return and more than makeup for everything else.   So far, so wrong.   Out of the 13 different projects I ultimately invested in, only 1 of them (ETH) is profitable. Just one. Thank Vitalik for Ether!   ETH: +15.7%  LRC: -3.1% BTC: -6.9%  Dogecoin: -7.2% CRO: -16.7% XLM: -20.2% ADA: -22.6% MATIC: -26.8% SOL: -28.7% DOT: -30.2% MANA: -30.8% ALGO: -31.4% AMP: -37.5%  I’d love to DCA some of these but, with a new house and a kid about to go to college, my fiat is locked up for several years. So, I’m curious.   Which of these projects do you see bouncing back into the green?   Which are going to zero?   And which is going ultimately yield the best return on my investment?   Good luck to you all!�9�0

2022-04-13 18:31:55�u2x0vp�"World's first metaverse Escape Room launched! Southeast Asia to become the ""Hub for the Metaverse."""�"Inspired by fictional events, historical stories, and different myths, ""LOST in Metaverse"" will host a series of immersive adventure games, LOST, the Hong Kong-based company announced.  The company, further said that players would be able to earn tokens and limited-edition NFTs while playing the game.  ""The whole concept of LOST in Metaverse is to create a play-to-learn, play-to-earn experience where players can form teams with friends online and solve mysteries together in the comfort of their homes,"" Rick Woo, Founder of LOST, said.  LOST isn’t the only Southeast Asian player eyeing up the Metaverse, however. In another significant development, HSBC Holdings said that it had established a fund to render investment opportunities to its high and ultra-high net worth investors in Singapore and Hong Kong.  HSBC will pinpoint investment opportunities across five areas in the metaverse ecosystem; infrastructure, interface, computing, experience and discovery, and virtualization through the Metaverse Discretionary Strategy portfolio.  As mainstream companies are increasingly warming up to NFTs and the Metaverse, projects associated with its ecosystem are expected to see more institutional money flow in. Protocols that boast sound fundamentals, such as Quint, a project that offers tailor-made NFTs designed by artists with an inherent eye for luxury; Sandbox, a virtual universe where players can buy and sell digital land; and Theta, a decentralized streaming protocol that revolutionizes web3 video rendering, are expected to see a mammoth surge in institutional interest.  Lina Lim, Asia Pacific's regional head of discretionary and funds for investments and wealth solutions at HSBC, stated: ""The metaverse ecosystem, while still at its early stage, is rapidly evolving. We see many exciting opportunities in this space as companies of different backgrounds and sizes are flocking into the ecosystem.""  With a multitude of global firms entering the Metaverse ecosystem, the virtual space is poised to shoot up high in Q2!"�23�0
2022-04-13 18:18:40�u2wq6s�Trading is harder than it sounds, I’ve been here for years and barely made a profit�My little cousin who literally just got started in the market just randomly started buying random things in the Metaverse like suku and mana and he’s already turned a bigger profit than I have in the last year. Am I a bad trader or is it just luck?   I always felt a little intimidated when it comes to trading. I would always be the first to sell and the last to buy, I misunderstood market patterns, and I would often stay out of the market completely even when everything is going green. I know I have some things to work on, but I also know that I’m not alone. I know there are a lot of people like me, who have not made that much money in trading at all.   I really believe that trading is not for everyone. There are people who can just get up and start doing it, and there are people who will do it for many years without turning a profit. It’s a really selective kind of job and there’s always a chance that it’s not for you.   If you are a good trader and have seen many successful trades in your lifetime, then good on you. In fact, I’d appreciate some pointers too. But if you are like me, you might want to stay out of the bear market lest you lose it all.   Trade well and have a nice day. Understand that what fits others is not always the best option for you.�20�0
2022-04-13 18:17:23�u2wp4f�Eth 2.0 is coming, so why are you still selling?�I don’t know if anyone here knows this yes, but eth 2.0 is almost confirmed, everyone is withdrawing their eth to hold them, so why are there people still selling?   Well, I believe that for the most part people are scared and confused. I wouldn’t really blame them, though I would advise these people move out of their comfort zone and do something better. It’s natural to feel afraid and alarmed during a bear market, I assure you that even the most venerated trader still does, but it’s unnatural to let your fears consume you. Breathe, think and hold.   Better yet, what I really suggest is just doing something else completely. Don’t sit around in fear and think about the worst. What you can do is use all the time you are not trading eth to research new projects in the market. Are you paying attention to what’s happening in the Metaverse? And how so many brands and names are making collabs with suku to enter? You can never know what you’re missing unless you look it up.   Hold your eth tokens boys. Good times are coming.   We held along to this point, let’s not surrender now.�23�0

2022-04-13 10:56:11�u2nmjv�Bitcoin, Ethereum Slip to Three-Week Lows! BTC is trading below $41k!�"Bitcoin and Ethereum, the industry’s two largest cryptocurrencies, are both down to almost three-week lows.  The crypto market's hopes for a reinvigorated Bitcoin (BTC) rally during last week’s Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami failed to live up to expectations; the leading cryptocurrency has slipped below $41,000.   The rest of the crypto market has followed suit, with the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH) down 5% for the day, currently changing hands below $3,100.  Arthur Hayes, the CEO of BitMex admitted that both BTC and ETH are “highly correlated” to the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 (NDX) stock market index, which is down 3.87% since last Tuesday.  “If the NDX tanks, it will take crypto down with it,” commented Hayes.  However, when the global sentiment shifts, fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies will be the quickest to recover. Nature's Vault, a project that uses blockchain technology to unlock the value of mineral assets without causing environmental damage; Terra, a decentralized blockchain payment platform for stablecoins; and Chainlink, a protocol that allows smart contracts to securely connect to external APIs and payment systems, may exceptionally grow in market cap once the major cryptos regain key levels.  ""It's only a matter of time,"" Hayes points out. Even the most trending cryptocurrency projects, LUNA and AVAX, are down 8.17% and 7.39% respectively. The current dip is an opportunity to seize to achieve a better ROI!"�13�0

The introduction of the altcoin's consensus layer, as well as the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, has been put back to Q3 2022.   The Ethereum merger has been postponed until Q3 2022.  As Ethereum transitions from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, the Merge is a much-anticipated event among Ethereum holders. The Ethereum development team renamed the update ""consensus layer"" instead than ""ETH2"" in January 2022.  An Ethereum core engineer, Tim Bieko, verified that the protocol's anticipated switch to Proof-of-Stake is set for Q3 2022. While the cause for the delay is unknown, Bieko acknowledged that this is the ""last chapter of Proof-of-Work.""   According to Parit Hosh, a Validator Whisperer at the Ethereum Foundation, the final testnet phase might span three months. The testnet's early completion is critical for the mainnet's introduction of the consensus layer.   Proponents believe the much-anticipated event will have a beneficial impact on the price of Ethereum. The Ethereum Triple Halving thesis, which anticipates a surge in ETH price comparable to three and a half Bitcoin halvings, was motivated by the inclusion of burn with the EIP-1559 protocol.  After a sharp drop in price over the previous week, FXStreet analysts assessed the Ethereum price trend. The Ethereum price has a swath of support extending from $2,800 to $3,000.   According to analysts, Ethereum's slide below the high volume node around $3,300 is a bearish indicator, and the altcoin may remain stationary."�33�0

In fact, I sort of sympathize because I too am afraid. But in reality, after years of experience I now know that it’s more fearful to be in a bull market than in a bear.   Bear markets will make you rich, you just have to understand how to use them. Stray away from fear, and especially don’t overleverage. Split your buys over a number of stops, and hold on until you are in profit. Take command and keep fear to the sidelines.   There’s nothing wrong with taking profits when you get them. In fact, use your profits to buy things. Real products. There are as of today sites and platforms that let you buy things with crypto directly like what exeno is doing, or which you could do with Binance pay and their card program. Use your profits to buy things that way you won’t over withdraw and you’ll stay within your purchasing limits.   Don’t let your fear hold you back, use your rationalization.�66�0

[ Patronize a Star sky cards  ](https://preview.redd.it/5sxdu28j0jt81.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1eb5f68e7998e576b4dd0bea3f8a76d4d167fe42)  After the war started not too far from his borders and after looking at the long list of recent and ongoing wars on the planet in general, he realized we are too crowded or too fixated on our planet. We fight and growl like in a small closed group tired of each other.      One of the easiest remedies for a brewing conflict in a pab/bar is just to take a pause and have a walk before one gets too much into it. Similarly for us as humankind, a good thing to do is to get our minds beyond our planet and indulge into research of endless territory we have just 60 miles above our heads.      Such an approach helped to end the cold war between the Soviet Union and the U.S. The whole confrontation gradually turned into a peaceful space race as a series of competitions between the Soviet Union and the United States: who would be the first to launch an orbiting spacecraft, a piloted spacecraft, a space crew, a Moon rocket, a space station… Flights were scheduled to preempt media publicity from the competition. Temporary victory veered from one bloc to the other, with each claiming — or at least implying — that being momentarily ahead in the race was proof of the superiority of its political and economic system, just as Olympic gold medals were (and are) risibly interpreted as markers of national quality. That worked then and can work now.      There are no right and wrong in a conflict, everyone wants to achieve their own goals. Attracting attention to peaceful space exploration rather than exaggerating the current conflicts would dissolve disputes and get the whole humankind to the new level of progress.   So he founded the Patronize a Star NFT campaign  The campaign has two goals:   * Shift government and society attention to peaceful space exploration, and  * Fund better and faster space research.  That’s why the campaign was brought about.  Currently there are three phases of the campaign:  1. First is the 12 NFTs airdrop. The purpose is to get the first holders and spread the word about the campaign  2. If you are late for airdrop, the next step is the presale for as little as 0.02 Eth. There is no plan to have such a low price in the future.  3. Other NFTs of the campaign are presented at Rarible and Opensea at the full price.      When you as a contributor buy one of those NFT, the main part of your contribution goes to charity. But that is not all. The project has developed an innovative approach to the sphere of charity allowing contributors to get a possible profit. While it would not be appropriate to sell a trophy or a plaque one got for a contribution in the real world, it does not derogate the contributor in the NFT world. The first contributor is minted into the blockchain forever as the first owner. However that contributor can resale his/her NFT further to collectors who would be interested to collect the whole constellation or to get a particular star they feel a relation to. So in Patronize a Star campaign the holders are welcome to resale their NFTs in which case the creator fee of 10% goes to charity. So the whole system can help holders to resale with a profit as well as to contribute to peaceful space exploration again with that resale.     The collection is going to be of 10 000 items, approximately 120 brightest stars for each of 88 constellations. Since it takes time to generate sky chart NFTs with geospatial software, only one of constellations has been released so far with the first 120 stars. 36 of those were pre-minted for open markets. Those are the brightest stars of the Aquila Constellation. Find them on Rarible and Opensea. The next 12 are reserved for the airdrop. And then next 36 reserved for the first 0.02 Eth presale.     The whitelisting for the airdrop and the presale is done through a great service Premint.xyz. No verification is required. The actual minting process is provided by great service Factoria.app.   The community is r/PatronizeAStar.�60�0

2022-04-14 15:27:58�u3k347�What do you think of this Ethereum merge delay?�"As we all look for solutions in some really helpful platforms and tools, I believe we're all looking forward to seeing what the Ethereum merge looks like; perhaps that would be a perfect solution for all of us. It appears trustworthy, however, as I've heard today, the shift to proof-of-stake may not happen until the fall.     All these years it was hard dealing with expensive gas fees, slow transactions, and all these issues that come along with ETH, I remember that I  tried a lot of L2 platforms, but I figured it out that Metis really does the best job for me, so I'm sticking with it.  But I must admit that I was excited about the news when I heard the first time of Ethereum merge, so it was quite disappointing to hear that they decided to delay the merge.     Ethereum’s move to PoS, where users reserve the ability to secure the network by “staking” ether, is expected to cut the network's energy costs by 99% and make it easier for Ethereum to scale. They say that the signs are promising that the Ethereum mainnet will actually merge with the beacon chain to become a Proof-of-Stake network this year.     What I've found in one article as an explanation is: ""Central to these latter stages are the trial runs of public test nets such as Kiln, and the roll out of shadow forks which enable devs to test various merge/PoS-related implementations on the network. Another important factor is the difficulty bomb (an automated increase in mining difficulty designed to make PoW mining less attractive), which Beiko says will start to be noticeable on Ethereum around May and make blocks unbearably slow by August.”"�8�0

2022-04-14 04:05:25�u38okl�Ethereum developer jailed for 5 years for violating North Korea sanctions�"Virgil Griffiths, the former developer of Ethereum has been sentenced to 63 months in prison and will pay a $100,000 fine for attending a conference and helping North Korea use blockchain technology in violation of US economic sanctions. US District Judge Kevin Castell of the Southern District (TADAWUL:3050) in New York issued the decision on Tuesday. Judge Castell stated that “what you see here is a deliberate intent to violate the penalties system,” adding that the crime was exacerbated because Griffiths had “a desire to educate people on how to evade penalties.” In September 2021, Griffiths pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that prohibits US citizens from exporting any ""goods, services, or technology to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) without authorization from the Treasury's office"". Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)"". In early 2019, Griffiths failed to obtain permission from US authorities to travel to North Korea. But in April, he went anyway and visited the capital of Pyongyang for a Blockchain and Cryptocurrency conference. At the conference, he gave presentations in a North Korean suit on how the country uses digital currencies to evade sanctions and money laundering. He also provided methods on how to use smart contracts to the benefit of the country in nuclear arms negotiations with the United States. In an effort to mitigate his sentence, Griffith's defense team provided evidence of factors that may have caused him to act irrationally. They provided a psychiatric evaluation for Griffiths, which showed that he suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). Obsession with North Korea His defense team said a diagnosis of obsessive personality disorder and NPD explains Griffiths' ""obsession"" with North Korea and likely ignored warnings from his friends, family and government about unauthorized travel into the country. At the hearing, Griffiths was given the opportunity to speak, saying he regretted his actions adding that sanctions imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine ""showed their value"" and that he was ""cured"" of his ""obsession with"" North Korea. The court did not appear convinced that Griffiths was remorseful, with Judge Castell saying: ""The fact of the matter is that Virgil Griffiths hoped to come home as a hero in crypto to be admired and praised for standing up to government sanctions, for his courage and nobility."" Griffiths was arrested in November 2019 by the FBI a few months after he returned from the conference. He held several meetings with the office regarding his trip before his arrest and even provided them with photos of him giving presentations at the conference. North Korea has become increasingly sophisticated with its use of digital currencies to evade sanctions and use hacks and exploitation to steal millions of dollars. In January, a report by Chainalysis revealed that North Korean hackers stole nearly $400 million in 2021 through crypto-exchange and ransomware hacks using a micro-laundering system that includes decentralized exchange swaps and various crypto tools."�5�0

It is both an Inbound Oracle and an Outbound Oracle with features designed to ensure information validity and action traceability:  * `Open` because it is built from open-source software and made available as open-source software for full transparency * `Trustless` because the network allows participants to interact publicly or privately without requiring a trusted 3rd party. * `Permissionless` because anyone can participate without authorization from a governing body. This is valid for both consumers and providers.  # Why Portus Network?  * Democratize the Data Oracle market: `anybody can become a Data Provider` * Replace validators with decentralized insurance and arbitration * Engage the community through delegated staking insurance pools * Reduce complexity and hurdles: stateless node, no validators, no quadratic communication * Significantly lower fees, only the gas fees of every integrated blockchain to be paid * `Bring all kind of external data` in the blockchain, not only numbers: unlimited possibilities, Portus Network enables numerous functionalities of smart contracts * User friendly API Gateway that `connects` smart contracts with any event from the real world  [https://www.portusnetwork.org/](https://www.portusnetwork.org/) \- Website  [https://twitter.com/portusnetwork](https://twitter.com/portusnetwork) \- Twitter   [https://t.me/portusnetwork](https://t.me/portusnetwork) \- Telegram   # Technology  * Stateless node that can be run by `anybody, anywhere` * Ultra high-performance message routing and validation * Create complex API orchestration workflows, combine APIs, apply transforms and validations * `Multi-blockchain integration` * Multiple messaging models: request-response, push-pull, fanout, inter-chain * Advanced circuit-breaker capability to prevent failures * Embedded message security: IP filters, quota, clickjacking protection, XSS protection etc.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/bridnzyjuqt81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f6ee9d87f0df18a1298b384e45d774a6566ea03  [\#PortusNetwork](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PortusNetwork?src=hashtag_click) is coming to Polygon to connect dApps to real-world events.

2022-04-15 18:37:26�u4eogq�A coordinated cryptocurrency withdraw from CEX on 4/18. Does Ethereum need to follow suit?�In light of Monero's Monerun, I'm excited to see the outcome!   >**Monero’s obfuscated ledger has enabled a number of exchanges to misrepresent their reserves, and sell XMR that they don’t actually have, knowing that all too many of us will never withdraw, and no one can see onchain the evidence of their misdeeds.**   >   >**April 18th. We’re withdrawing XMR from exchanges. Any exchange that hasn’t disabled withdraws (which many of them have already), we’re pulling our funds.**   Unfortunately, XMR is not the only coin with this issue. CoinBase has been creating notes for ETH and LRC among many other cryptocurrencies (if not all) and does not actually hold them in reserve...  For the CEX who have not disabled XMR withdraws, I am very excited to see the effects of Monerun on 4/18.  I wonder if Ethereum should have a similar movement since most CEX do not hold Ethereum as a reserve also... is this right for CEX to do or is it plain shady?

It’s an idea that seems so obvious in hindsight, but it wasn’t until the last few years that we’ve begun to see the speed at which this future is coming to fruition. We’re not just talking about crypto exchanges or blockchain-based financial services; we’re talking about a fundamental rethinking of the way money works, with a focus on open-source code and permissionless networks. 🔥  ApeX is a decentralized, permissionless, and non-custodial platform that allows for the creation of perpetual swap (funding) markets on any token pair. Perpetual swaps are derivative contracts that allow two counterparties to conduct a margin trade, where settlement does not occur until one party terminates the contract.   The successful launch of the beta version of the protocol on Arbitrum mainnet, seed round fundraising, and its soldout 4,580 unique NFTs, have brought an eventful beginning for ApeX. 👍  Checkit: [https://www.publish0x.com/bit-media-buzz/introducing-apex-a-decentralized-non-custodial-crypto-deriva-xmmqkey](https://www.publish0x.com/bit-media-buzz/introducing-apex-a-decentralized-non-custodial-crypto-deriva-xmmqkey)�0�0

2022-04-16 22:24:55�u58sse�The most underrated investing skill is the ability to do nothing 99% of the time.� If you get good at this (surprising hard skill), your long term returns will likely thank you.  What do I mean by this? When the market’s doing its thing (going up and down), sometimes it’s hard to stay on the rollercoaster. But those who get on and off regularly statistically miss out on the majority of the Crypto market’s returns.  It’s a hard skill to learn because while the market is plummeting, the natural instinct is to exit, but statistically, the best thing to do is hold on and buy more.  Not financial advice�7�0
2022-04-16 22:20:07�u58pc9�Investing is a good addiction.�The first few dollars you make from your investments will have you hooked for life.  Once you realize that it’s possible to get paid for doing nothing (aside from delaying gratification), you’ll want to invest every dollar you have.�1�0
2022-04-16 22:17:52�u58nov�Increasing your income will speed up your journey to financial freedom. You can only cut your expenses down so much, but you can increase your income exponentially over time. The critical part: once you’ve increased your income, maintain or marginally increase your expenses.�Frugality is excellent, but frugality alone will only get you so far.  If you want to reach financial independence well before you turn 65, you’ll need a high income.  However, a high income alone will not get you there faster.  What matters is the gap between income and expenses.  This gap is what builds wealth, not solely your income or expenses.  Build that gap up by either increasing your income, decreasing your expenses and invest the difference in high-quality assets. Your future self will thank you.  Note: wealth isn’t everything. It’s all about balance. You don’t want to sacrifice your mental health (at least not for long) to increase your income or decrease your expenses. Find a happy medium. In fact, even if you are trying to maximise wealth, this may be the best strategy because it’s the most sustainable over a long period.�1�0

2022-04-16 21:34:19�u57s87�Ethereum's Importance�" After reading several articals I think that Ethereum has been adopted by the crypto community and industry as the chain of choice for most blockchain-based decentralized apps"" (DApps).    I believe that Ethereum and its compatible networks clearly outweigh all others in terms of the number of DAOs. According to Snapshot, a blockchain voting platform, there are over 4,200 DAOs and protocols that require governance members, which I found fascinating.    From my point of view another indicator of ETH's importance and value is the fact that Ethereum drives about 95% of the NFT ecosystem, so it's no wonder that when investors seek for an NFT marketplace, OpenSea, Rarible, Nifty Gateway, and others come to mind.   To keep up with all of the new collections minted on the ETH blockchain, we need to employ search engines like LUDO or equivalent that look like Google for NFTs.    In terms of tools for founding and maintaining all aspects of DAOs, especially financial but not exclusively, Ethereum is the most established ecosystem. As other chains gain prominence, this may alter. ""How do you feel about the importance of ETH?"�8�0

2022-04-16 21:12:23�u57ce4�ETH has the potential for growth this year!�The much-anticipated Ethereum merge, which was supposed to happen before June 2022, has been postponed. Even before the merge, a $10 billion bet has been placed on the autonomously-run Defi platform Lido Finance for the Ethereum network overhaul.     According to the latest news, roughly 3.22 million tokens have been put on the Lido finance protocol in the hopes of completing the Ethereum integration successfully.     The announcement of the Merge's postponement, on the other hand, hasn't had a negative influence on Ethereum thus far. As things stand now, ETH is expected to continue to rise over the next three months. Given the economy's and liquidity's problems, the rise is likely to be turbulent.     Ethereum is trading downward on a 7-day chart. ETH was selling for over $3200 just seven days ago, but it is today trading for less than that. ETH, on the other hand, has not fallen below $3000 in the previous seven days, despite the market being in turbulence.     For ETH, the previous 24 hours have been a period of recovery. However, because the rebound has been limited, ETH has failed to break beyond $3100. One of the key reasons for this is that the trading volume for ETH has been steadily decreasing over the previous 48 hours.     ETH has lost over 20% of its value since January 2022, whereas BTC has lost 15% of its value since January 1st 2022.     What's your opinion on these numbers, is this the time for investing in giants like BTC or ETH, or investing in small projects such as crayon?�11�0

You could literally mint NFTs for free on Polygon and bridge them to Ethereum. And USDC payments only Polygon cost fractions of a penny as well.  I don’t know about other scaling solutions cause I’ve only used Polygon for now and I’m satisfied for now, but I assume that anything is better than using the Ethereum mainnet.  And yeah I get that that there will always be that type of person that doesn’t use anything but Ethereum. But these are a very small minority cause I bet you that 99% of people reading this use an L2 or some sort of scaling solution.  So yeah, kinda weird how I still see these posts and tweets. An brief explanation would actually be interesting.�1�0

Do you think those properties will continue to go up in the coming decades? I don't care about what will happen next year or two years from now.  I think real estate is a long long term investment.  I want to know what the california housing price will do over the next 3 decades.  What about properties along the coast? specifically along the pacific crest highway? Do properties like these appreciate more in terms of percentage compared to inland california prices?  What do you guys think?�0�0

2022-04-17 19:23:05�u5u5mx�Is Staking Crypto A First Step to Your First Million?�When you first start in the crypto industry, it can be overwhelming because of the many different coins and ways to make money. It is easy to get frustrated with bad investments and trading. However, to confidently earn income, you should consider cryptocurrencies that have indeed proven resilient.  Even if you missed out on the early rise, it’s not too late to make money on crypto today. Armed with staking features, we’ve got some really good earning opportunities here. What’s more, staking and time are the main weapons of a passive crypto investor. In a nutshell, this is all it takes to become wealthier one day.  **What are the rewards?**  The final rate of return is determined by the choice of the coin, the staking period, and the type of staking. In most cases, payments are 6–15% per annum of the amount of assets on the account. The best I’ve seen were 20-23% APYs on [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/) platform.   You can also find some insane rates in DeFi space, such as 200-300%, which I've never tried (do not inspire confidence in me).  Let’s say you decide to start making crypto with crypto and finally make more crypto with a more amount of crypto. The action process is simple here: the interest in the form of crypto, accrued on the invested capital, increases the starting size of your investments at the beginning of the next period, and hence the amount of future income. Add the potential growth in the value of the cryptocurrency itself, and you get the most result that crypto investors could ever dream of.  **Dream big**  Your desired million-dollar mark will depend on your initial investment, monthly replenishment, and the period.  Let’s take an example.  \- You were lucky, and you did everything as correctly as possible. You invested $5,000 to buy 1000 N tokens when the price was at the dip. The staking rate — 15%. Let’s say a bull market started, and you kept investing 700 N tokens every month whatever the price was. This wonderful scenario has lasted for 2 years. Once again, you predicted the end of the bull market and decided to stop just before the bear market began.  So what is the result?  \- After performing mathematical calculations and assuming that the price of your cryptocurrency has increased 10 times during the bull market, you get the coveted million!  Still don’t believe?  \- Well, when it comes to compound interest and bull market opportunities, everything is possible. By initially buying 1000 N tokens and replenishing 700 N tokens monthly, you accumulate about 20,099 N tokens over 2 years. With all those conditions mentioned, the total value of your assets will be around $1,005,000.  **There is no guarantee**  Having a clear understanding of the risks of cryptocurrencies themselves and their volatility, it is worth asking the question: “Are there any risks for cryptocurrency staking?”. Staking can provide promising profits, however, it can also lead to some notable setbacks that you should take into account before staking a cryptocurrency. Here are some risks you may find:  * **Liquidity**. There is no guarantee that you can convert crypto assets back to cash or other coins, as this depends on supply and demand. * **Lock-up period**. There is no guarantee that your lock-up period will end before the price falls. * **Loss or theft**. There is no guarantee that your funds won’t be stolen or lost because of fraud or project failure. * **Staking interest rate**. There is no guarantee that the staking interest rate won’t change.�7�0

2022-04-17 18:15:28�u5sslk�Do you think ETH will be used on a daily basis in the near future?�I started thinking about what we might buy with ETH because there are so many projects and businesses that now accept this sort of payment. Above all, Ethereum was created with the goal of emphasizing smart contracts and decentralized, self-executing agreements that are embedded in the network itself.     All of these potential benefits are available with ETH, and I've seen that an increasing number of businesses are currently accepting ETH payments. Consider NFTs: we may purchase all of these tokens with ETH and use them to pay for other services provided by other projects and marketplaces, such as SK8coin or any other that accepts ETH.     I must state that I did not use ETH to pay for anything directly. When we look at this more closely, we can see that we are already utilizing ETH to pay for a variety of products, even when we omit the tokens we buy for future payments.     Do you use it to buy NFTs or to pay for services or goods? Do you think ETH will be used on a daily basis in the near future?�15�0

2022-04-17 07:02:58�u5hksn�Russian crypto bill will work wonders for the future of crypto�So post the crypto bill that Russia has released, people have been taking up different views on it. So far, the bill shows no bias, though shows obvious mediums of regulation coming through.   What you may not know, is that Russians have billions in crypto. This has surged post the Ukraine-Russia war, as Russians began to fear losing the value in their local currency (which they did). This was also occurring in Ukraine, where people even began selling and buying things with crypto, such as cars and food. And as a result programs that endorse direct crypto payments like Binance Pay and Exeno were grown ever so popular. People began downloading methods and way to pay through with ways other than fiat or credit cards, and it worked.   Publicity is publicity, and crypto grows in both good and bad. If the bill were to pose as a mediator with severe crypto regulations on mining and cryptocurrency payments, it will make people even more attracted to crypto as a rebellion from that system. If it were to promote crypto, people will be encouraged to use it to connect back to the world outside as much as possible.   There is no way for crypto to go but up. People have realized its power, and it’s hard to go back from this.�45�0
2022-04-17 06:53:37�u5hg33�Don’t sell your eth just yet, hold in out until the next update�The next update is so near, yet I still know people in real life who are selling to pay off things. This is one of the worst things you could do, and profits should be used to make more profits.   I’m not against selling profits. But you should be using profits to buy real things only. Like what you can do with sites like exeno or Binance pay, the former offering you a broad range of products directly and the latter giving you confidence in reputation. Never sell your profit and hold it in cash.   Cash dies out. And it is already. Look what inflation is doing to the world, does that not scare you?   Instead, most cryptocurrencies employ deflation, and holding makes you only more powerful rather than less. Markets are not diluted, they are ever more concentrated, as demand goes up ؞ and supply goes down. Crypto has learned from our economies, and made their structure better. Credit is not a good system. In crypto, what you see is what you get.   Don’t sell and regret it later, sell what you need and hold what you can. Fiat won’t be here for long, do not ride a sinking ship until it drowns.   There’s much to learn from the crypto markets and they are constantly improving, we’ve worked hard to get here, let’s not let go of it all now.�33�0

2022-04-18 14:23:46�u6ed35�Has anyone bought icETH? Why did you choose it over other yield options?�Hi, I'm a community member at Index Coop. Index Coop (IC) is a decentralized and autonomous asset manager that provides a range of products allowing crypto investment in a simple and efficient way. icETH is the most recently introduced among IC's products.  The Interest Compounding ETH Index (icETH) provides enhanced yield on Ethereum (ETH) by using Lido's Liquid Staked Ethereum (stETH) as collateral to recursively borrow Wrapped Ethereum (wETH) through Aave to procure more stETH. All of this is abstracted away into a single token. With icETH, holders retain spot exposure to ETH plus amplified staking rewards.  icETH was launched just two weeks ago and already has over 10M in AUM according to Dune Analytics. Since this marks one of Index Coop's most successful launches to date, I'm gathering feedback on why this was the case and how we can do even better next time. Please feel free to not only describe why you chose icETH, but also why you didn't if that's the case: any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated too. Thank you for reading.�1�0

Ideally looking for wallets with all the necessary features (Displays NFT's, atomic swaps, something that doesn't break all the time like Metamask)  Cheerio!     **EDIT:** Ty for all the great recommendations. From all the suggestions in the comments I ended up choosing [Liquality.io](https://Liquality.io). The UX felt superior and it has all the features that I was looking for.

2022-04-18 09:04:51�u68p6r�Would you consider Ethereum to be in a danger zone with no prospect of a merge?�"I actually expected Eth to be under pressure and users to be frustrated as we witnessed all of these delays in an overhaul of its underlying blockchain network.     All of us are waiting for these big changes which were expected in June. The aim is to cut traffic congestion on the network and reduce high transaction fees, which would be a significant development in the world of cryptocurrencies. Because of all these difficulties and issues, we started to use all these L2 platforms, Metis, or something similar since we need a solution.     Because Ethereum is the dominant network for ""smart contracts"" and DeFi, I believe this delay is extremely problematic. It serves as the foundation for a variety of crypto trading and lending activities. It is also extensively used as the foundation for  NFTs, and tokens that attempt to function similarly to digital dollars with a set value. Delays in the upgrade might jeopardize the ETH supremacy.     Ethereum merge may now be delayed until the fall, so we will see how will things develop at the time.    Wa+hat are your thought on this? I must admit that I was quite disappointed."�13�0

2022-04-18 08:49:28�u68hbn�If you have a $1 million portfolio, at the current rate, inflation is eating $,75,259 per year.�Inflation (measured by CPI) came in at 7.5%—the highest since 1982.  In essence, this means that your cash is losing 7.5% purchasing power every year.  It’s likely a lot more because CPI is heavily manipulated.  I believe the actual figure should be ‘$69,767 every year’ for every $1,000,000 in cash, but someone correct me on my math if that’s wrong (1,000,000/1.075).  Inflation is deceitful because you don’t actually lose 7.5% of your money every year; don’t lose any money. You lose purchasing power.  What $1,000,000 purchased a year ago, now costs $1,075,000, on average.  This is why we MUST invest — to protect our purchasing power.�3�0

2022-04-19 18:10:02�u7bj1g�Survey | Marketing in NFT Art - In which ways artists can leverage Digital Marketing activities to sell & advertise their artworks in the NFT new paradigm ?�"Hello there,  I am conducting a research about Marketing in NFT Art. The goal is to answer to the question: ***“In which ways artists can leverage Digital Marketing activities to sell & advertise their artworks in the NFT new paradigm""?***  The advancements around NFT artworks, blockchain technology, and crypto currencies have the potential to have a profound influence on the dynamics that have defined the art market for decades, especially regarding the value and ownership of the work of artists. According to Gartner's Hype Cycle for Critical Technologies of 2021, NFTs based on their unique characteristics have the potential to dramatically revolutionize digital marketing functions and techniques. In this context, artists considering the use of NFTs should consequently be aware of the marketing opportunities and their consequences. Indeed, interesting new marketing techniques need to be discovered and understood.  The purpose of this study is to lay the foundation for this new creation by demonstrating how the combination of art and marketing in the digital era might be reflected in the NFT world.  In this context, **I built the following questionnaire**: [**https://neoma.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_3z4NzYt7ckh5xrM**](https://neoma.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3z4NzYt7ckh5xrM)  *If you are interested to be part of the study, please answer to the questionnaire.*  The goal is to gather experiences and perspectives from everyone participating in the NFT ecosystem, including artists, enthusiasts, collectors, and investors.  The survey is divided into four sections. This first section discusses your thoughts on NFTs and how you have used them and intend to use them in the future. As a Crypto enthusiast, the second part will examine your behavior and relationship with NFT Art and NFT marketplaces. The third section will examine your behavior and experiences as an NFT artist. Finally, the fourth section will examine digital marketing techniques that artists are currently using or will be using in the future to promote their work in the NFT world, comparing them to traditional and digital art market techniques.  This survey will take approximately 15-25 minutes, so be sure to get a beverage and give your best ideas on the subject. Your responses will be used for a master’s thesis that discusses how Crypto Art and NFTs are transforming artists' digital marketing operations. As a sidenote, the survey results will be anonymous.  If you have more in-depth comments or suggestions, please email me at [*anthony.galasso.19@neoma-bs.com*](mailto:anthony.galasso.19@neoma-bs.com) with any informations you would like to share.  Thank you for your time!  \-*Anthony Galasso, master's student at NEOMA Business School, photographer & NFT artist*"�0�0

2022-04-19 17:36:07�u7aq17�UniSwap class-action lawsuit another black eye for the Ethereum Network's decentralized claims�This follows on the heels of Metamask blocking transactions, Infura blacking out large geographical areas, NFT platforms seizing property, several dapps integrating blockchain forensic products, and too many others to list. The most frightening part is that anytime these are brought up, they're rapidly dismissed with an ever worsening set of talking points.  [https://blockworks.co/crypto-exchange-uniswap-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-wrongdoing/](https://blockworks.co/crypto-exchange-uniswap-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-wrongdoing/)  *#DINO* seems like it should be trending again soon (Decentralized In Name Only). This class-action has enormous implications for altcoins, not just because of the liability it exposes faux decentralized projects to, but because of the securities angle. The only thing worse than an unfavorable judgement would be UniSwap settling out of court. That would be a blow even the most ardent believers in the protocol couldn't handle.  ETH is emerging as little more than a gas token which acts as an all-access pass once a user reaches the web3 mansion gates. Inside what awaits them is an orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes, run by centralized dapps that do nothing but optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going. And the only things that has established themselves as money in the protocol are stablecoins. That's why 85% of all the Ethereum Network's volume are STABLECOINS. That's an example of *Gresham's Law* at work:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law)  Stablecoins track the price of fiat, meaning they'll blow up along with it. That's what LUNA's UST finally realized as well. Point is, with the Ripple lawsuit approaching completion this year and giving the SEC legal precedent, along with the disastrous revelations of the last 60 days of how easily governments coerced dapps to comply, along with what's certain to be an avalanche of lawsuits, it's time to consider the s-curve adoption shakeout for the crypto space is rapidly approaching. Lastly, there are rumors that the most recent Merge delay has a few law firms collecting names to sue ETH developers on behalf of clients who locked up ETH in the Beacon Chain. It's time to dump ETH.

2022-04-19 11:32:59�u72zb5�Mainstream status doesnt happen overnight. Its a journey.�I bet all my money that the public and entire governments will eventually realize the true utility and hidden potential that lies in crypto and how it can end up helping us a lot in our everyday lives.  My other bet is that in the case that we do indeed end up going mainstream, Ethereum would lead being the spearhead of the metaphorical crypto spear piercing into mainstream status.  This is mainly for the fact that it’s renowned for its safety in the crypto world and that its the best platform by a long shot when it comes to smart contracts and building. And even when scalability comes in the way there will always be scaling solutions to solve that.  People make of scalability issues such a big deal but I don’t think the same when there are projects like Polygon investing literally billions into Zk technology development and helping more and more builders use Ethereum especially considering Polygon has more than 10,000 operating dApps.  Its a major problem for sure. But I don’t think its major enough to stand in the way of mainstream status honestly.  Given enough time, I have a huge belief based on educated research that if we keep up this pace we WILL go mainstream and Ethereum will be up there at the top.�1�0

This year brings us low Ethereum gas fees since they have been on the declining trend since January 2022. This week, it touched the lowest mark in the last six months. Ethereum gas fee has also gone down due to the decrease in the volume of NFT trading. Users expressed a lower interest in trading NFTs. So, does that mean that ""NFTs are just a trend"", as many people said before?     We should keep in mind as well that the fewer transactions related to decentralized apps and NFTs attracted less congestion on the network. The lower congestion further reduced the gas fee for the Ethereum network.      So, what do you think about all of this? Is it good for ETH users, but bad for NFTs?"�18�0

Most of my comments now don't get any upvotes, and in the last two days I'm seeing my comments getting downvoted without even saying anything controversial.  These are either people downvoting or downvote bots, due to the low amount of karma being earned on r/ethtrader the value of an upvote increases and donuts become easier to manipulate using bots.  Please upvote for the love of donuts, I'll start upvoting almost everything that's not completely low effort and I want everyone to do the same, upvote this post to spread the word.�75�0

Ignoring details, we now pay only 27.5% per trade crypto->fiat, or for buying things using cryptos, and NO tax event is caused by swapping cryptos, which is AMAZING! :D  For those of you who don't know (most, I guess), we used to have to pay percentage in increasing steps, with the tax percentage going up to about 55% income tax once enough profits accumulated. Swaps also created a tax event, because it was considered a trade.  Where do you live and what are your laws? :D�27�0

2022-04-20 11:20:00�u7u6dt�Despite all of the criticism, P2E games are truly evolving�Play to earn only accounts for 1% of the global video game industry, but it has a huge fan base that believes in the future of NFT videogames and their ability to shape the metaverse.      I still have high hopes in P2E games, especially when I read [this](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/in-depth-features/nfts-and-play-to-earn-games-shed-light-on-future-of-metaverse-economy/A5540926-5121-48CC-9248-78478BEAF38D) that blockchain technology allows players to earn cryptocurrency and NFTs in games.      Gaming has pushed many industries in its time. There's a good chance that it'll be at the forefront of NFT, as well as the metaverse.       Many metaverse companies promise interoperability or the ability to travel between virtual spaces with the same virtual assets. And some play to earn games are already experimenting with this idea to some degree. Like, Axie infinity as one of the more popular play to earn games that hit its peak in 2021 also Splinter lands that according to dappradars data, has been the most played game for 9 months in a row, and major media outlets are finally keeping a close eye.     It is evidently seen that the play to earn aspect shows how it can encourage people to learn about crypto and NFTs. But as with all things crypto it’s still too early to tell how valuable or permanent those assets will be.        Despite its passionate fan base, p2e has experienced pushback from some longtime gamers who are saying that this is just another way for companies to squeeze money.        P2E is still evolving and these new technological developments in the gaming industry are the best thing that has ever happened.�150�0

Leaving it in the spot wallet means the BETH earns staking rewards, but does the same thing happen if its simultaneously being tied up in a purchase order?  Say, I want to set a sell order at 1.0 so I convert my BETH straight to ETH 1:1 now, will I continue to earn rewards while the order is in place?

2022-04-20 00:20:26�u7jlzk�Is buying Mayc a good strategy if I need 6x in my portfolio?�In my current portfolio I only need to make at least 6x more in order to make it, I'm holding various cryptocurrencies and NFTs.  But I'm wondering if it would be a good strategy to convert everything (or some part) to Mayc NFT in order to reach that profit. I'll explain why.  Mayc current floor price is around 30 ETH, it's likely it will reach around 100 ETH floor price in near future. Ethereum current value is 3.1k, it's very likely it will reach 10k usd at some near future.  So if I convert some ETH amount to Mayc, and it does 3x (around 90 ETH in the current prices), it will increase my ETH amount 3x, if the ETH price at that time is 9k, per example, it will be around 9x my initial investment (3x from selling Mayc and 3x from ETH by itself), a bit more my current goal.  If at the time of the Mayc selling Ethereum isn't yet above 9k, it's likely just a matter of time.  I can afford some Mayc, but even one single Mayc at current prices represents a huge amount in my portfolio, so I'm pondering about the risks.   So I would like to know some thoughts about that strategy, would it be ok or too much risk?�2�0

Surprising considering it aggregates liquidity from most major pools including:  * KyberSwap * uniswap (v2) * uniswap (v3) * sushiswap * curve (3pool, aave, saave, hbtc, ren, sbtc, eurs, link) * balancer * synapse * shibaswap * defiswap  In addition to aggregating liquidity it will automatically determine the best ratio among the pools and will sometimes perform swaps from multiple pools to achieve the highest token per $ in my tests. Am I missing something negative about KyberNetwork, why does it seem underutilized?�0�0

2022-04-21 16:52:54�u8s32y�What's next for Crypto, DeFi, NFT? Here are the trends I see to continue�I’m excited to update my investing focus to be all about the economic empowerment of individuals — across crypto and fintech. Here are the top trends I’m watching and participating in that will shape how the individual builds wealth and makes moves in the coming years:  * **Regulation comes to crypto**  2021 saw many government bodies and financial institutions, exploring the financial impact of cryptocurrencies on global economies and many central banks were weighing the risks to their financial stability from digital assets. Bitcoin was banned in China, and India took initial steps to introduce regulation banning all private crypto assets. However, BTC was adopted as legal tender in El Salvador  Without a doubt, 2022 will see even greater governmental interest and regulatory activity, such as the creation of the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). According to the CBDC Tracker, currently, 79 countries are at various stages of researching and developing their own digital currency.  * **Broader Web 3.0 Adoption**  More intelligent, connected, and open, web 3.0 is one of the biggest evolving cryptocurrency trends of 2022. A blockchain-based version of the internet, it will allow individuals to regain control of their data, remove the possibility of a site crash resulting from a single point of failure and enable website owners to avoid reliance on the companies that own the servers. As Web 3.0 takes off, linked cryptocurrencies will thrive in 2022.  * **A Bitcoin Resurgence**  Having hit a peak of over $67,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin dropped to $35,000 in mid-January but has already started to bounce back. FSInsight, in a note to investors, said Bitcoin could hit $200,000 in the second half of 2022, a climb of over 460%. While some analysts are projecting a Bitcoin collapse in 2022 to as low as $10,000, based on what is deemed a lack of fundamental value, others hold the belief that Bitcoin will rally, continuing its overall upward trajectory surging back to its previous high and surpassing it to exceed the $100,000 mark at the bare minimum.  * **More passive income with crypto**  In 2021, the industry saw massive earnings accompanied by investments from major corporate giants and financial organizations. The popularity of crypto investment platforms to earn interest is likely to continue in 2022 since many are just holding their assets. Growth is also anticipated in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi). Banks too are showing increased interest, but they are less likely to outdo 20% APY on USDT[ offered](https://midas.investments/assets) by Midas.Investments. And at the same time, it is a cryptocurrency for many to be a safe haven in these difficult times of high inflation.  * **Every creator platform will launch an NFT**  Another of the top cryptocurrency trends in 2022 will be the continued growth of the NFT market. Non-fungible tokens utilize smart contracts to open the door to decentralized funding for artists and offer a highly secure means of authenticating the ownership of digital assets. As a result, the NFT market is gaining in popularity with increasingly high valuation as more artists seek to gain control over their work.�7�0

2022-04-21 16:22:19�u8reim�Will try to earn on Ethereum�Two of my ETH are already dusty in my wallet and I decided to delegate it so that they will bring me an excellent passive income. I chose the option to supply my ETH to the lending pool on DEX. I calculated that I will earn with an APY 82% on wowswap about $217 per month if I provide 1 ETH. And I have two questions:  &#x200B;  1.  If the course of ETH starts to dump, is it better for me to withdraw them in order to get rid of non-permanent losses? 2.  If I decide to provide some more ETH for the pool, but the APY changes, for example, it will be 70% on wowswap, at what APY should I count the profit?   &#x200B;  Thank you and have a good evening!�0�0
2022-04-21 16:21:41�u8re2l�Computer Security Basics - These Are Some Safety Measure My Group Uses To Protect Themselves Online - Its Geared Towards Crypto But Useful All Around�   As someone moves into the Crypto space they might become more interested in computer security. Not everyone is familiar with how to increase their security and privacy from hackers.  This list is intended as an easy quick reference guide for desktop/laptop users that are concerned about protecting their Crypto assets. As always and most important DYOR.  1 Disc Encryption- Most computers come with disc encryption but its not always turned on so check. This protects your hard drive.   2 Firewall- There are 2 kinds software and hardware= Software types are on most computers but not always turned on so check = Hardware types can be purchased and your modem/router also might have one built in. You will have to plug the computer into it to use it. You can use both at the same time. And it stops someone from trying to see your information over WiFi.   3 Modem/Router logs- Most routers can be accessed through the makers designated website. You can clear the router logs so the online history of what sites you visited isn’t available. Modem/Routers should also be periodically checked for updates. They aren’t always automatically uploaded. Turn off public hotspot functions so others don’t have access to your service. Hide your SSID broadcast.   4 Encrypted email- Most of the popular email services have a way to do this and there are other email providers that focus on this. There are two things to look for. In transit and at rest. In transit protects it while it being sent. At rest (the email reader) protects it when it gets to the other person so the service that shows them the email doesn’t read it themselves. It’s helpful to use a dedicated email strictly for Cryptocurrency.  5 Anti-Phishing codes- This service is available from certain websites. You pick a phrase that is only know to the site. When the official site sends you an email the phrase will be included. Malicious emails won’t have this word attached and will identify them as a scam.   6 Encrypted messaging- There are many different apps that offer encrypted text messaging.  7 Anti virus protection- Its always good to have and use some type of program. Free programs are available but not recommended   8 Ad and Tracker blockers- There are programs you can get to cut down on how many people are tracking your online activity. There are search engine/browsers that have this ability built in.   9 Clearing History- Clearing cookies and cache and other history on you computer and/or browser should be done regularly. Using private search windows are also helpful.   10 Managing Cloud Storage- Apps and programs will sometimes connect to your cloud storage system. Restricting ones with sensitive data will eliminate the possibility of someone hacking the cloud and gaining access to personal information  11 VPN (Virtual Private Network)- A VPN can change you IP address to the website you are visiting. There are free ones available but they aren’t recommended.   12 TOR (The Onion Router network)- Tor has the ability to change you exit node and make it look like your computer is in a different country than you are to the website you are visiting. If you use this make sure it is the official TOR. There are may fakes.   13 Hardware Token (key)- Hardware tokens are a device that you plug directly into the computer. They perform the task of Two Factor Authentication (2Fa). They are the most secure way to accomplish a 2Fa and you don’t have to give extra personal information out online. They are good to use for an Exchange.  14 Authenticators- These are free apps you can use that also perform the task of 2Fa. They aren’t considered as safe as a hardware token but are better then the SMS \[text message confirmation\] that are sometimes the default security setting on exchanges.  15 Password Managers and BIO Scanners- Password managers act as a vault for all of your passwords so you don’t have to write them down or try to remember all of them. There are free ones but you get what you pay for. BIO Scanners are fingerprint and facial recognition. They can be helpful also but aren’t perfect.  16 Cameras and Microphones- Covering cameras and microphones are a good way to prevent someone looking and listening directly into your living space.  17 Social media- Not posting excessive amounts of information online can prevent you from being targeted. Hackers sometimes look for people that constantly post crypto information online.   WARNING- Using some of these guidelines might prevent you from performing certain actions that you’ve done in the past. Like the computer may not be able to connect to a printer and would require a change in settings or a cable.   Some of these steps are free to do. It is up to you to decide what level of protection you want to protect your funds. I didn’t include any specifics here because I’m not shilling anything. Plus just because a product or service is good today and works for one person doesn’t mean someone won’t have a better one tomorrow that works for someone else.�3�0

2022-04-21 11:16:36�u8l7fm�Half of the credit must go to scaling solutions for assisting Ethereum in maintaining its position�It's definitely true that you can’t love Ethereum without loving scaling solutions. We couldn't use Ethereum the way we do without scaling, L2 solutions, whether that is Metis or Loopering, we need them.     Ethereum worked hard to establish itself as the first and greatest multi-use chain on the market, as well as one of the safest networks available. However, becoming the greatest in one area is one thing, and retaining that position is quite another. So far, Ethereum is the best network in terms of raw numbers.     This status wouldn’t have possibly been sustainable without scaling solutions stepping up their game and helping people operate Ethereum. The fact is that commit chains like Polygon have more daily active users than Ethereum itself, owing to the fact that you actually spend pennies there compared to double-digit gas fees on Ethereum, as well as being able to mint NFTs for free there.     We must all admit that Ethereum did an excellent job establishing itself, but half of the credit must go to scaling solutions for assisting Ethereum in maintaining its position.�21�0

I'm not really surprised but it was interesting to find out all this stuff.     When it comes to food, in some countries Burger King, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, etc are accepting payments in crypto.     Microsoft lets you use BTC to shop at their Windows and Xbox stores. You can spend some cryptocurrencies in various hotels and CheapAir accepts 10 different coins for you to spend on your flights. These are things that are part of the entertainment, but what about some serious stuff?     For something serious I consider paying taxes, many charities now accept crypto donations, you can even invest Unicoin in companies with high expansion potential (Unicorn companies). You can buy luxury properties around the world not only with Bitcoin but also with Ethereum, Cardano, Ripple, or DogeCoin.      Have you used cryptocurrencies for these sorts of things, did you buy some food with it lol?"�13�0

2022-04-22 18:09:54�u9kvys�Ethereum Price Analysis�Markets have been taking a beating as inflation fears and a hawkish federal reserve have lowered investor sentiment. ETH and BTC have been trending together, and are currently around $3k and $40k, respectively.  The Ethereum merge is still coming but was delayed until Fall ‘22. It is likely that we are still about six months away from the merge occurring, which will transition Ethereum to a Proof of Stake model. This transition will also reduce ETH emissions by 90%, making it deflationary even with such low network usage. While this is a long-term bullish outcome, six months is an eternity in the crypto market.  Price indicators do not look good in any time frame right now. The 4H looks bearish, the daily looks neutral at best, and the weekly looks bearish. Investor sentiment shows room to decline, and fundamentals are in decline (at least in the short term).   The macroeconomic environment does not look good for ETH either, as the Federal Reserve has taken an increasingly “hawkish” stance, signaling rising interest rates and further turbulence for speculative markets such as stocks and cryptos. It is likely we will see a big capitulation event at some point in the mid-term, which will present a great buying opportunity for long-term holders. In the long term (3+ years) ETH still looks very bullish, but the market will get worse before it gets better.

2022-04-22 14:25:46�u9fx1g�I've always been intrigued by technical progress�After Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency. Many NFT marketplaces that offer ETH-based transaction services attest to its popularity.     OpenSea, for example, is an Ethereum-based marketplace where you might gain greater exposure and consumers ready to buy or bid on NFTs. There are a variety of these marketplaces currently, and it appears that new ones are popping up on a daily basis. Sk8coin looks so promising and can't wait to see how the whole project would look-alike since it is so unique and encourages artists and young skilled skaters, which is fantastic.     I've always been fascinated by technological advancement because seeing all of these new discoveries and being a part of them is entrancing. I consider myself extremely fortunate to live in an era when technology is reaching new heights.     The bulk of NFT collections are created on the ETH blockchain, and ETH provides us with a large number of them. I was surprised by how popular NFTs have become in recent years among certain art collectors and investors. Digital artwork has sold for millions of dollars, prompting some investors to purchase NFTs in the expectation of getting wealthy rapidly.�11�0

I was wondering what if they offered to pay me, their employee, in cryptocurrency, should I accept it or not?    What would you do, what will be your decision? What would you consider as the pros and cons of this type of payment?     I've been using ETH since and soon after I started using Metis as a solution, so being paid in ETH would be quite comfortable for me. I'm not sure if they pay their employees in a 50/50 split - that is, 50 percent in your home currency and 50 percent in cryptocurrency.     Would you be obligated to accept only one form of cryptocurrency, or could you change it? I assume that among us there are people who are already getting paid in crypto so it would be nice to hear your experience with it, was it tough to get used to this type of salary?�12�0

2022-04-23 15:43:03�ua86mr�All of these cryptocurrencies might be life-changing, but no one can promise success�Remember that purchasing pizza with bitcoin a few years ago? Now you can be filthy rich if you have them, so the crypto-mania can really bring you a lot if you're lucky enough or if you know which projects to invest in, and I'm interested how you pick which one to invest in, or to buy some coin?     All of them might be life-changing, but no one can promise success. However, a few initiatives, such as Unicoins, appear to be promising for future sustainability, which is quite unusual in the crypto market today.     As a result, I determined that Unicoins should be invested in hundreds of rising growth enterprises with strong development potential. The best aspect is that income from such investments will be distributed as dividends to all Unicoin holders on a regular basis.     Of course, there are many more advantages and reasons (saving me from a heart attack owing to certain pumps and dumps), but why would I invest in that and similar projects?     If you have any recommendations or more interesting news about it, please share them. I'm always on the lookout for new ideas to invest in.�7�0

2022-04-23 15:04:58�ua7e1e�Cryptocurrency and Tax Evasion: The Reality�The cryptocurrency industry's connection with the rest of the world is a bit shaky. On the one hand, it has had remarkable success in recent years, with increased public awareness and more individuals joining the market than ever before.  In addition, the crypto industry has been the focus of both public and regulatory criticism and allegations throughout the years. One of the most prevalent claims is that Cryptocurrency can be used to evade taxes. This has been cited as a foundation for anti-crypto regulation and public anti-crypto sentiment. Nevertheless, is this a legitimate claim? Or, How easy or complicated would it be to utilize crypto for tax evasion?  Using Cryptocurrency to Evade Taxes  Decentralization is one of the most important aspects of cryptocurrencies, which means that it is not issued by a central bank and is mostly independent. In order to transmit and receive bitcoin, a crypto user can establish an anonymous crypto wallet, which no one can block.  A major advantage is that large sums of money may be transferred from one user to another at a reduced cost and with a greater degree of anonymity for everyone involved. This is where there is concern that Cryptocurrency may be used to evade paying taxes. Exactly what's stopping people from using crypto wallets to transfer money to others and then not reporting it as an income source?  It is necessary to keep in mind that cryptos are money and that their value is derived. While it is still possible to avoid paying taxes by using cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, doing so is becoming increasingly difficult and improbable. Especially because anyone can track crypto assets using a block explorer unless someone is using anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero or Zcash. However, there have been reports that regulators have been working with some blockchain firms to create software than can even track these anonymous tokens.  On the other hand, it's far more difficult to purchase bitcoin on an exchange without paying taxes. It is becoming increasingly common for crypto exchanges and tax authorities to demand proof of identity before a user can open an account, and penalties can be imposed if the exchange does not comply.  Although it is possible to avoid paying taxes by sending someone Cryptocurrency, the Cryptocurrency must be converted into fiat before it can be utilized in most nations. As there aren't many businesses that accept Cryptocurrency, tax evaders may need to use other methods to avoid paying taxes. Once the funds have been placed in an account, they may need to be accounted for in some way.  Although crypto payments for goods and services have existed for a long time, many of them go unnoticed since cash can be used for real-world transactions without the complexity that crypto entails.  Even if people go through the exceedingly arduous method of moving money via cryptocurrencies and do not expose their identities, this will constitute a very small percentage of cryptocurrency holders, which in turn are already a very small proportion of the world's population.  Even in recent headlines about strengthening crypto tax legislation throughout the globe, the reality that these cases are mostly insignificant is acknowledged.  Taxation Norms Tightening Across the Globe  Despite the fact that some loopholes might be exploited to avoid taxes by using cryptocurrencies, they are being addressed all over the globe.  Anyone may create a cryptocurrency wallet without having to identify oneself (there are crypto wallets with millions of tokes whose owners are unknown), but opening an account on a cryptocurrency exchange without providing some sort of official identity is becoming increasingly difficult.  In certain jurisdictions, exchanges are even required to disclose users' activity to tax authorities, and crypto tax regulations are being updated in countries all over the globe to reflect this. As such, several services are springing up to help cryptocurrency owners file their taxes and stay in compliance with the law.  The use of bitcoin for tax avoidance is a major concern for the regulators at large. According to all available information, this is a very real possibility, although a very small one. Cryptocurrencies, for the most part, aren't being abused for illegal purposes, and those few exceptions that do still exist are being closed all around the world.�2�0

The gaming sector was the next to reach a successful blockchain milestone.

I was first opposed to this sort of crypto/NFT game, usual hater haha, but now I can't imagine not playing all these fantastic NFT-powered games, my favorite of which is now K4 Rally, enjoy it and if you're like racing games, I truly believe you'll be fascinated shortly after you start playing it.

I know how horrible it can be when it comes to the price of gas costs because I invested in ETH myself. So, what are your thoughts on this one as a solution?     I'm amazed by the Andromeda network and how it operates these days; Andromeda is a whole structure that offers a diversity of unique features.     Andromeda Layer-2 Network, EVM Equivalence, Metis Explorer for checking and verifying on-chain transactions and smart contracts, Multi-VM, decentralized virtual machines, and tools that aid in the security and scalability of Metis Layer-2 infrastructure Peer nodes for fraud detection, Metis Bridge for token transfers between the Ethereum main net and Metis Layer-2, DAC Saking and Mining, and a Polis hub where users can create wallets or connect with Metamasks and developers can manage smart contracts are all included in Andromeda.     So, as far as I can tell, Metis is an open protocol, and the Metis Andromeda network is available to any developer or team interested in launching a DApp, token, or any other type of project on their EVM Equivalent platform. It should be incredibly fast and very inexpensive; please let me know if you have any experience with this since it appears really promising; I even found several YT users talking about it and they find it very useful and cool. Have you tried it?�13�0

2022-04-24 21:39:32�ub51kj�After reading this excellent interview with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, I realized that I can completely relate to his way of thinking�"I recently read a fascinating interview with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak on cryptocurrencies. After reading it, it really made me think since I can absolutely connect to his way of thinking in which he talks about how everything may be hazardous and give you a lot of problems, which is usually the case, and I'm sure all of us who invest are aware of this for the best.     His comment regarding Bitcoin piqued my interest: ""Bitcoin is basically gold."" Nobody owns it, after all. It's just arithmetic."" But, because I admire this guy and think he's really brilliant, I was curious about his pros and drawbacks, especially because the disadvantages include Bitcoins, which many people are passionate about.     I had no idea he was involved with the online reality program ""Unicorn Hunters,"" in which he is an investor. I liked how he introduced this new token Unicoin, which, as far as I can tell, helps fund start-ups that pitch to investors on the show I mentioned earlier and pays dividends based on the performance of those firms. In other words, it is an opportunity to invest in start-ups. It appears to be fascinating, and I would be interested in hearing other people's thoughts on the coin he mentions.     If you have any further information, I'd appreciate it if you could share it with all of us. Have a great day, people!"�7�0

2022-04-24 20:41:36�ub3t3l�Which sport, in your opinion, should include NFTs in its activities?�Have you heard that, according to a Deloitte study, NFTs for sports media would produce more than US$2 billion in transactions in 2022, nearly double the number for this year?     The sale of limited edition video clips of sporting moments or player cards will be the most common and profitable application of NFTs in the sports industry. The worth of each NFT is determined by the athlete's celebrity, the significance of the event, any additional content included in the NFT, and demand.     They began to implement in sports so quickly, and I've seen that football and basketball performed an excellent job with NFTs, bringing so many advantages and rewards to spectators. Now, I see it becoming fascinating in motorsports as well; there are certain racing teams that are sponsored by NFTs, and there are racing teams who have their own NFT p2e game (K4 Rally for example).     Some other piece of sports news is that the format will attempt to blend real-world and virtual competition, as well as leverage the triathlon's potential as an esport. Indeed, World Triathlon and Super League Triathlon feel that their partner is the next step in developing the notion of competitive gaming into a new and legally recognized triathlon discipline.     Which sport, in your opinion, should include NFTs in its activities?�8�0
2022-04-24 20:20:17�ub3d85�Have you noticed how the promise of blockchain for improving people's lives and establishing more resilient organizations is increasingly being recognized by large enterprises and governments, rather than simply a small number of hyper-technical IT professionals?�According to what I've heard, towards the end of the second half of 2022, there will be a bigger need for blockchain and crypto capabilities. The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, the increasing popularity of blockchain across a wide range of businesses, and the potential for development in the blockchain industry all contribute to an increase in demand for blockchain and crypto capabilities.     Have you noticed how the promise of blockchain for enhancing people's lives and building more resilient organizations is rapidly being recognized by huge corporations and governments, rather than just a tiny hyper-technical group of IT professionals?     That's why as a result, organizations want blockchain specialists to assist them in using blockchain technology to accomplish their objectives.     I discovered a few fascinating companies about which I wanted to learn more after completing more research into the blockchain market.     Duet Protocol is one of these companies, and what I've discovered about them so far is that they are a multi-chain asset platform that can be used to build an asset for usage on the blockchain.     I really like their concept, therefore I'm forward to seeing how this project evolves in the future! And I must repeat how fascinated I am with blockchain technology in general, simply amazing.

2022-04-24 15:03:18�uawnuz�Why does Ethereum have an intrinsic value? GLTA!!!�By: Emi Lacapra, Cointelegraph  1. What is Ethereum?  Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain and the first network to launch smart contract functionality.  Ethereum was launched in July 2015, and in the span of a few years, it increased considerably in value due to its wide range of decentralized application (DApp) offerings. The explosive rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have sealed its success as the most actively used blockchain network.  Furthermore, its native currency, Ether (ETH), has solidly maintained its second position by market capitalization and daily volume in the cryptocurrency space.  &#x200B;  [My all-ETH portfolio at 1-month low. I'm currently long-term 138.945+ ETH, staked and HODL through thick and thin to becoming the richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/g1pbe40brhv81.jpg?width=1103&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f0815fa313ed4fb59519d1a0fd6863e95a02e6b)  2. What is Ethereum’s intrinsic value?  Before identifying what is unique about Ethereum, let us first explore the definition of intrinsic value and how it applies to digital currencies like Ethereum.  In finance, the intrinsic value represents the perceived or actual value of an asset or a currency. It should not be confused with the market price because assets can be over or undervalued.  Fiat currencies like the United States dollar or the euro have intrinsic value because they are issued by monetary authorities like central banks and are primarily used in their economy.  What is the intrinsic value of digital currencies? Governments’ central banks do not back cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or ETH, but their intrinsic value could be defined by their scarcity, use cases and technological application. Over the years, cryptocurrencies have gained a reputation as a store of value and promise they can also become units of exchange in the future.  &#x200B;  [ I’m projected to earn 3.3 more ETH by the end of this year, taking my total of 7 ETH earned via staking. This is assuming the yield stays constant at 3.67&#37; APR. GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/4h8ysu3drhv81.jpg?width=1092&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1052a65cb46cf69c56df67c239df646e657b7d6e)  3. What is the true value of Ethereum?  Given that intrinsic value is an investor’s perceived or actual value of an asset, utility is crucial to why Ethereum has attracted interest and capital across the crypto community.  In contrast with Bitcoin, which was created as a money alternative to national currencies, Ethereum was built as a platform that could facilitate programmatic smart contracts and applications using Ether.  Smart contracts  Ethereum’s smart contracts have emerged as the platform’s primary utility, considering that they power valuable real-world use cases like DApps, DeFi and NFTs applications. They allow the automatic execution of agreements without the intervention of intermediaries like banks for financial transactions or lawful entities for legal arrangements.  Billions of dollars worth of assets are already locked up in payments, loans, insurance and any DeFi application shaping the future of finance. Ethereum smart contracts will likely change the way financial and public services are managed including categories like governance, supply chains, markets and digital identification.  Despite fierce competition from other blockchain networks, Ethereum remains the most popular platform for DApps, hosting the highest number of DeFi projects, NFTs and ERC-20 tokens.  4. What is Ethereum 2.0 all about?  Ethereum is shifting from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) governance mechanism in the foreseeable future, resulting in a faster and more efficient blockchain.  The Ethereum Network has experienced a considerable spike in transactions volume and size since DeFi and NFTs have captured the finance and art worlds. Such traffic has often caused systemic bottlenecks with a significant rise in fees that have made the blockchain unsustainable.  To bring Ethereum into the mainstream and support an increasing number of transactions, the need for a substantial transformation emerged. The upgrade from PoW to PoS will make Ethereum more scalable, efficient and sustainable while securing its fundamental decentralization.  The upgrade will occur only at the backend within a technical framework without affecting how users transact and hold assets across the network. Ethereum’s roadmap envisions the following three phases for the upgrade to complete:  Phase 0, also known as the Beacon Chain  This update is already live, and it brings staking to Ethereum. It lays the groundwork for future upgrades and will coordinate the new system.  The Merge  Mainnet Ethereum, which is the current network, will have to merge with the Beacon Chain at some point, and this is expected to happen in 2022. The merge will enable staking for the entire network and indicate the end of energy-intensive mining.  Shard Chains  Shard chains are expected to be initiated in 2023. However, sharding is a multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereum’s scalability and capacity. Shard chains enable layer-2 solutions to offer low transaction fees while improving the network’s performance.  Sharding is the process that allows smaller sets of nodes to process transactions in parallel without needing to achieve a consensus across the entire network. Ethereum 2.0 promises to bring transaction speed to as many as 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) through the deployment of shard chains, in contrast with the 30 TPS currently in place.  Ethereum’s transition to PoS has generated a heated debate within the crypto community. While some of the resulting benefits are clear including scalability and sustainability due to a more energy-efficient system, many fear decentralization could be at risk due to its implementation.  The PoS validation process may trip over large holding validators who can have excessive influence on transaction verification, thereby impacting the true nature of decentralization. Detractors of the transition also see sharding as a threat to the network’s security. Because fewer validators will be needed to secure the multiple and small shard chains, there is a higher risk that they could be more exposed to malicious actors.  How will Ethereum 2.0 impact Ether’s intrinsic value?  Many crypto experts believe 2022 will be a make-or-break year for the price of Ether. The digital currency experienced an extraordinary rise since its launch in 2015, going from a mere $0.30 to a high of $4,800 in 2021, including highly volatile motions along the way.  Will Ether keep up with its massive growth through the shift to ETH 2.0? While it’s impossible to predict the price of any asset based on technical or fundamental analysis, crypto investors unanimously believe that ETH 2.0 will impact the intrinsic value of Ether, and a lot will depend on the smooth implementation of the upgrade.  As with any significant transformation, the initial deployment of ETH 2.0 might be a direct cause of volatility. Until the upgrade is thoroughly tested, approved and effective across the network, experts predict months of uncertainty which will inevitably affect the price of ETH.  In the long term, the transition to a more sustainable and efficient PoS will benefit Ethereum’s adoption for users and companies building on the platform. However, the way and timing this will all pan out is a cause of hesitancy among investors showing signs of caution with their allocation until there’s a more accurate outlook.  A lot will depend on the resulting upgrade success in demand and functionality and if the renewed platform will be able to keep its leading position among all other innovative network competitors.  5. Can Ethereum be a store of value?  The competition with BTC as a store of value is open. Due to its real-world usage, ETH has the potential to become the dominant digital currency, according to financial analysts.  Both BTC and ETH have long been regarded as hedges against inflation due to their decentralization and programmable supply. While Bitcoin’s limited supply of 21 million coins is a clear feature, Ether’s supply is not limited but considered disinflationary.  Disinflationary supply  In contrast with Bitcoin, Ethereum has an unlimited supply of Ether. However, its circulation is capped every year through the mining process. This mechanism is called disinflationary because the supply is adjusted to the network requirements as it progresses and the price inflation slows down temporarily.  With Ethereum’s new PoS consensus mechanism, validators are rewarded a transaction fee for each verified transaction instead of miners being rewarded with new blocks, as it’s the case for PoW.  The staking mechanism ensures that Ether is locked up and the more coins are staked, the higher the chance they become more valuable because there are fewer in circulation. In a way, this process makes the cryptocurrency more scarce, even if in a different way from Bitcoin.  Ether futures  In February 2021, CME Group added Ether among its cryptocurrency offering alongside Bitcoin. This significant achievement means there’s an injection of more cryptocurrency traded in the markets, which might contribute to the rise of its value.  In December 2021, the CME Group also launched contracts for micro Ether futures, which are versions of the CME Group’s popular E-mini stock index futures contracts. They are smaller contracts than institutional investors’ contracts and are, therefore, more accessible and affordable to retail investors.  These are also expected to contribute to the value of Ether as more market participants from both institutions and retail investors gain more exposure to the cryptocurrency and hedge its price risk.�0�0

2022-04-24 12:14:43�uati0i�20 Laws of Part Time Trading�Here are 25 rules to consider if you plan to trade or are already trading part time. Trading for capital appreciation while working a full time job is possible but you must consider how to optimize your trading process so it doesn’t interfere with your work and also that you can execute your trading system consistently and with discipline.  1. Part time traders must choose a time frame that they can trade on. Swing trading and trend trading are usually the easiest to take signals for whether it’s executed at the open or close. It’s possible to day trade if you work nights and have enough rest to be able to focus completely. It’s not a good idea to try to day trade at work as you likely will not be able to do your job or trade well with all the distractions.  2. A part time trader needs access to the proper trading tools to execute their system, most will need a computer with a charting platform, few will be able to trade on a phone alone unless the strategy is simple and doesn’t require speed in execution.  3. If you have a full time job then you don’t need to risk too much capital trading to pay living expenses so relax and just focus on learning how to trade, no need to take on too much risk.  4. Scan, research, and create you watchlist before you go to work. You shouldn’t be trying to find and add things to your watchlist during working hours.  5. Before you enter a trade have a trading plan with your entry, exit, and position size all mapped out. Make it easy to implement in real time without much need to analyze. Create your trading plan each day before you go to work.  6. It can be easier to not over trade when you have a job to do. Letting your winners run should be the goal of any trader so just go about your work when your trades are going in your favor and you have no exit signal yet.  7. Don’t watch every tick of price all day, just check in at the needed planned on times to check your positions, watchlist, and signals.  8. Looking for a 1:2 or 1:3 risk/reward ratio at entry is a good filter for quicker trading decisions. Quick formula for risk/reward ratio: (Entry-Stop)/(Target-Entry).  9. Ensure on entry you are not risking more than 1% of your total trading capital if your stop loss is triggered with your position sizing. Quick formula to calculate you potential account loss percentage: (Entry price-Stop price) x Shares / Total trading capital.  10. Your stop loss signal should be based on a technical level you have quantified. A price, pattern, or technical indicator.  11. Don’t act on a trade until your stop loss, trailing stop, profit target, or time stop is triggered. This saves a lot of time staring at positions and checking in too much.  12. Designate the specific times you will check in on your trades and stick to those times only.  13. Position size an amount that allows you to not stress out about your trades and allows you to focus on other things until it is time to trade your signals.  14. Trade a strategy you fully understand and believe in, this lowers a lot of the stress over expectations.  15. Know your trading edge and take trades that allow you to use it.  16. Run your trading like a business not a hobby. Businesses make money, hobbies lose money, you should feel like you are a business operator not a gambler when you place your trades.  17. Don’t let financial news headlines through the day distract you from your job or following your trading system. Stick to your plan, and plan for everything.  18. Don’t talk about your positions with other people it will only make it more difficult to stay unbiased in taking your signals. Be careful to not engage ego or emotions in your trading by sharing your positions with others.  19. Pick stocks for your watchlist that are not too volatile to trade with your strategy. You want to trade stocks that you can use inside your system to set and forgot while at work and only check on when needed.  20. Stay on your trading time frame, don’t drop down to a lower one when you are at work, just get out of a trade if you need to watch every tick.  Trading part time can be an advantage over those that overtrade sitting at their computer all day. As long as you are able to follow a quantified system with an edge and do your job with focus you can make money as a part time trader. Execute your strategy with discipline at the planned times you have for checking your signals and taking action, until then focus on your job.  Credit:Steve burns�2�0

2022-04-25 17:31:46�ubqlef�Is ETH going down?�The price of Ethereum is in desperate need of some stability, which will arrive next week. The French elections will determine the outcome of a large tail risk event on Sunday, but FED speakers are entering their blackout period, which means Powell will not make any public appearances until the FED meeting in early March. Several assets in global markets have been rocked left and right by FED speakers' statements, profits, surveys on the French elections, news on Ukraine, and a slew of other side items in recent days, all of which required to be sorted and priced.     As a result, the ETH price will begin a peaceful trading week on Monday, with just minimal disruptions and greater opportunities for pure technical trading. The 55-day SMA has risen and is approaching the 200-day SMA, which is approximately $3,500. Although there is still a long way to go, a steady rally could bring the 55-day closed to the 200-day SMA, and the feared death cross could be undone by the first week of May, opening up much more room to the upside; for ETH, that would mean $3,687.17 with the monthly R1 and a historic pivotal level as a barrier.     The lack of bears might represent a misunderstanding of the trading environment, with bulls conducting that fade-in move. If the price action cannot close over $3,000.00, bears will continue to defend the territory and prevent the ETH price from reclaiming it. As a result, pressure will build on those positions from the failed fade-in trade, and they will gradually be cut short, resulting in a decline back to $2,695.79. The bears are surely not settling anytime soon, so my future picks are new perspective projects like Crayon or ROSE just for portfolio diversification. Still keeping it safe with some ETH and BTC on my wallet.�13�0

2022-04-25 15:58:50�ubofww�Germany is the most crypto-friendly country�TLDR: Germany is the most crypto-friendly country!  # Blockchain adoption  2019, Germany was the first country to adopt a blockchain strategy.  The German Savings Banks Association started developing fintech blockchain applications to enable customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.  To fund the development of these technologies, Roundhill Investments, an ETF sponsor focused on innovative thematic funds, launched the Roundhill Ball Metaverse UCITS ETF on the Deutsche Börse Xetra, Germany’s first metaverse exchange-traded fund.  # Crypto adoption  At the end of 2021, 2.6% of Germans have used cryptocurrency.  44% percent of Germans are motivated to invest in crypto.  German investors have multiple outlets to crypto and blockchain via companies and platforms like 1inch Exchange, Nuri, FinLab, Minespider, the NAGA Group, Tangany, Coindex, CryptoTax, Upvest, Fiona, Blocksize Capital, USDX Wallet, Bitbond and the Iota Foundation, or they can shop on Sugartrends using Dash.  Germany is among the top 10 countries for crypto mining and is home to the European Union’s largest mining company, Northern Data — which is powered almost entirely by renewable energy.  # Startups  Numerous blockchain startups have settled in Germany’s crypto capital of Berlin.  Paycer startup specializes in cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance, developing a bridge protocol that will aggregate DeFi and cross-chain crypto services and combine them with traditional banking services.  Forget Finance startup focuses on motivating young people to save and invest in crypto using online coaching via a mix of AI bots and real financial experts.  # Central bank digital currency  Germany’s central bank, the share of cash payments in point-of-sale transactions made by German consumers dropped from 74% in 2017 to 60% in 2020. Accordingly, Bundesbank has been working on distributed ledger technology asset settlements.  Bank is exploring creating a CBDC, dubbed the digital euro.  # Nonfungible tokens and the metaverse  In 2017, the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe acquired a number of NFTs, well ahead of the craze of 2021, and it is now exhibiting works from its own collection and private lenders on the “ZKM Cube” — an outdoor, publicly viewable cube-shaped screen.  German sportswear company Adidas has teamed up with Bored Ape Yacht Club and with Prada for a charitable climate-focused NFT art project on the Polygon blockchain to raise awareness.  Volkswagen has launched a successful interactive NFT ad campaign.  Utherverse has combined the best of the internet, gaming and virtual reality for the ultimate metaverse experience. Having developed more than 100 patents and pending patents for core internet technologies and the metaverse, Utherverse is the undisputed leaders of metaverse architecture and VR economics.   # Regulation of digital assets  Germany is one of the few countries in Europe that has started to regulate cryptocurrencies ahead of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA, regulation.  Germany’s crypto custody regulation requires those who control private keys on behalf of others and serve the German market to receive a license from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, regardless of whether they hold other similar licenses within the EU.

2022-04-25 09:24:55�ubh0y1�What do you believe is the most significant advantage of blockchain technology?�Since I start getting familiar with the blockchain tech I was curious about what it can all provide to users and it was a quite an amazing revelation since we're using it almost every day and we had no idea (international payments and money transfers, money laundering protection, insurance, or healthcare).  But I would like to single out some benefits that are considered the most important, maybe it would help someone who is a rookie at all this since I was as well until a few months ago lol.  Transparency is one of the big issues in the current industry. To improve transparency, organizations have tried to implement more rules and regulations. But there is one thing that doesn’t make any system 100% transparency, i.e., centralization.  Security (which I consider the most important thing when it comes to blockchain tech), blockchain networks are also immutable, which means the data, once written, cannot be reverted by any means. Zenotta's blockchain turns any file (jpg, pdf, etc) into smart data on their blockchain, that's how much blockchain security did develop (grateful for that).  Reduced Costs, by using blockchain, organizations can bring down a lot of costs associated with 3rd party vendors.  True Traceability, thanks to blockchain, the supply chain is more visible than ever before. It allows each party to track the items and guarantee that they are not being replaced or mishandled along the supply chain process.  The final industrial benefit of blockchain is increased efficiency and speed. Blockchain eliminates time-consuming processes and automates them to increase productivity.  Which one do you consider the most important?  &#x200B;  [Source -  101blockchains.com ](https://preview.redd.it/pnf61ifl8nv81.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=243805c35c313b5964f188e49af2486c5757f6b9)  &#x200B;�9�0

2022-04-25 08:46:07�ubgh5o�What do you think Is the best Blockchain for GameFi developers?�"In 2021-2022, the GameFi industry, or games in which you can spend or earn cryptocurrencies, had fast growth. The crypto gaming business is currently worth $34 billion, with a daily trading volume of $7-12 billion on the main exchanges.     P2E video games (GameFi) make use of blockchain and related technologies like NFTs and cryptocurrencies to give players a way to earn real-world incentives that can be exchanged for real-world money. In other words, the long-held gamer's fantasy of being able to make money from playing computer games is finally a reality.     As you may know, in these games, players compete for prizes, which may be either cryptocurrencies or NFTs that represent in-game items such as guns or participant ""skins"" or vehicle components, as I've seen in K4 Rally. These awards may be exchanged on third-party marketplaces for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens, allowing players a way to cash out and pay for their gaming efforts.     Because of the Ethereum blockchain's first-mover advantage, the majority of crypto video games have been built on it. As the first blockchain with reasonable contract capabilities, Ethereum has garnered hundreds of decentralized applications and a strong community of developers and customers.      But developers are having problems with high gas fees (as usual) which customers pay on every transaction, these transactions can typically take a number of hours to course. Is it true that many developers are now considering Cronos? I read bout it and find out that it has a number of key benefits over Ethereum."�11�0

2022-04-25 08:11:56�ubg0lo�What do you find most interesting about blockchain?�From the beginning of the blockchain tech, I was very amazed by it, I love to read about it, and discuss it, so I was looking always for some fresh news and projects that have something with it.     It's interesting how blockchain technology, in its different forms, such as the Ethereum blockchain and others, is a worldwide consensus system that allows users to coordinate and collaborate around a neutral source of information without requiring users to trust one another or a single authority.     Banking and energy trading, as well as supply chain management, are examples of use cases. Despite the fact that shared ledger technology has been explored for decades, the Bitcoin blockchain was the first decentralized distributed ledger system that was impervious to censorship, confiscation, and collusion.     What do you find most interesting about blockchain? Have you stumbled upon some cool projects recently?      After reading many articles on the subject, I wanted to learn more about companies that use this approach. Duet protocol is a multi-chain synthetic asset system that sharpens all assets for use in the blockchain world, which makes sense given that a duet is a piece of music in which two people perform unique portions or melodies at the same time. As a result, I'll be exploring this project.     I am continually astounded by how rapidly the blockchain industry has expanded. Don't you think it's amazing?

2022-04-26 19:26:54�uckk0x�Is there any social network that uses blockchain?�Blockchain is present in more processes and activities that we conduct on a daily basis than we realize. I had no idea until a few weeks ago when I began reading some stories about it.  But I was wondering since blockchain has all these advantages, especially has a huge part in protecting users' data, is somehow involved in any social network?  We leave all this personal information about us on social networks, so imagine Facebook being hacked or any other social network, that would be a disaster!  But we have today so many solutions that can provide us security through blockchain, I even read this article on the Modex website (which provides all these types of data security through blockchain) and started thinking more about it since then.  Keeping this in mind, could you imagine combining blockchain with social media should be another trend in 2022?  Because of the characteristics of blockchain technology, it might be used to assure that all social media content is untraceable and uncopiable. Furthermore, consumers will benefit from increased security and control over their data. Isn't that a win-win combination?�12�0

2022-04-26 18:04:34�ucip9u�The Merge might be the most important factor driving Ethereum's price increase, or not? Analysts are divided for now.�Proponents of ETH expect the price to decline due to worries of increased selling activity after the Ethereum Foundation reported that Ether accounted for 80.5 percent of its assets. If treasury reserves are in ETH, many operations or payments to partners or stakeholders are likely to be liquidated, increasing the odds of Ethereum tokens being listed on exchanges.     The anticipated Merge, as well as more transparency in the Ethereum Foundation, should enhance investor confidence. The Ethereum network's developers have announced a delay in the Merge, raising concerns about a negative trend reversal as layer-1 solutions gain traction. The Merge's delay is viewed as a red flag by some experts, while others disagree.     Ethereum's Merge, according to Travis Kling, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Ikigai Fund, might be the largest catalyst in crypto history. The delay, according to Kling, moves the Merge to the optimal period for an Ethereum price increase, and it might work as a trigger.     As the most telegraphed event in crypto history goes live, Kling believes Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin. While Bitcoin outperforms following each halving event, Kling feels the Merge is still unpriced since ETH becomes deflationary, yield-generating, and environmentally benign all at once. Kling is positive on the ETH price as large amounts of institutional cash come into the cryptocurrency.     Is this the time for the switch from BTC to ETH, or not? It's certain that you don't actually need to rely on any of these giants 100%. You should either one or both in your portfolio, but I personally think diversification is still the key. The diversification itself is still all about the new projects because you want that moonshot potential. Choose whatever project seems good to you, if you don't have any, I'd strongly recommend looking into Crayon, ROSE or even QREDO, as those are my picks for some time now.     However, Justin Bennett, a well-known crypto analyst and trader, predicts Ethereum's price will fall lower before it begins its last relief bounce. The latest retreat, according to Bennett, might push ETH lower before it breaks out.�11�0

A growing trend is the increasing number of programming classes offered pre-college! In my own high school, we had 1 JAVA class which was a great introduction to programming, but now some elementary schools are offering programming classes! Even DISNEY has created their own programming class for kids, this is huge. It would be great if these courses included Solidity for programming for the Ethereum blockchain, but it's a great movement overall that there are increasing courses for coding for the blockchain technology.  We all know Argentina has been supportive of cryptocurrency this decade and they are furthering planning to teach about cryptocurrency and blockchain in their schools! That is so awesome!  >**Some 4,000 students who participate in the educational project will learn about the benefits of a decentralized financial system based on blockchain technology.**   >   >**In the initial phase of the project, training and vocational guidance will also be offered to teachers and students on the importance of Bitcoin.**  There is increasing interest in teaching the younger generation about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, I hope this awesome trend continues!

2022-04-26 12:08:45�ucb2e7�Do you think that blockchain is changing the world?�"Some believe blockchain technology has the ability to transform practically every aspect of our lives, well beyond the influence of cryptocurrency on our financial portfolios.        As more, I read about it and heard of so many great platforms and projects that use blockchain, whole this notion seems very possible since blockchain is implemented in almost everything we use.       We have now the blockchain so many great projects, recently I find out about Modex, they develop scalable products and services that transform the way data and digital assets are stored, shared, and managed using blockchain technology. Or maybe you've heard about Zenotta which brings great things with their Smart Data which turns digital content into a digital asset. Literally, any file type, static or dynamic can be turned into smart data.       That's why I'm so impressed with this blockchain tech, it can be used by regular computer users and as well for many complex operations by large companies and IT professionals.       One great explanation I've found online about blockchain: ""The blockchain is basically a distributed database. Think of a giant, global spreadsheet that runs on millions and millions of computers. It’s distributed. It’s open-source, so anyone can change the underlying code, and they can see what’s going on. It’s truly peer to peer; it doesn’t require powerful intermediaries to authenticate or to settle transactions.""       Would you say that blockchain is really changing the world? I would say one big YES to that and I'm so thankful that we have it!"�12�0

I was thrilled when I found out about play 2 earn games, love them, and play them often. Remember when Axie Infinity made such a boom with the game, everyone was hyped with it lol.      These people who support this new model of gaming say that gaming should be fun. Duh! It is fun! Have you played Axie, K4 Rally, or CryptoKitties?? If you play these games then you'll know how fun can it be, right?     So, does anyone have an idea what is the difference between play2earn and play&earn??�8�0

2022-04-26 10:13:25�uc9713�What is the exact reason for these merge delays, does anyone know?�"All of us with this merge expected that Ether is going to do better. It has promised to go to the next level, edging out crypto rivals and even outshining the Bitcoin but we're hearing all the time about all these delayings, people become nervous and some of them believe that merge even won't help that much as it was told it would.      How are you dealing with this situation now that it has been postponed until after the summer?     As I remember it was supposed to be weeks away from the ""merge"", a transformative June upgrade of its blockchain Ethereum to make it faster, cheaper and less power-hungry, holding out the prospect of a meaner and cleaner crypto future. Until then I have Metis (wouldn't change it for anything lol), but I'm becoming a little bit suspicious about this merge, it wouldn't surprise me if they postponed it until next year.     What is the exact reason for these delays, does anyone know that?     It's concerning that ETH is now using a proof-of-work approach, which is a highly power-hungry process that is predicted to produce more pollution than a small country per year, fueling concerns about crypto in a low-carbon future. As a result, because the proof-of-stake method consumes far less electricity, the merger should take place shortly."�11�0

2022-04-27 17:57:09�ud9m3n�Buterin claims that Ethereum's simplicity can still be achieved.� It is still conceivable, according to Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, to reduce Ethereum's complexity while expanding its functionality.   Several developers have recently expressed worries about ETH's complexity, prompting the disclosure.  He emphasized the Gasper PoS version, which ETH will eventually merge into, noting that it is a tough but really strong system, according to what I've read.   In comparison, there are many simpler and weaker PoS solutions that could have been viable candidates, but they lack Gasper's advantages.    Buterin explained that Ethereum has been torn between two visions: one that prioritizes safety and simplicity (like Bitcoin does), and another that aims to make Ethereum a highly performant and functional platform for developing complex applications.   It would be amazing if we could lessen the challenges that ETH presents, especially given the high gas prices and the overcrowded network, which produces havoc.   Because most NFTs are minted on ETH, and because there are so many of them, you'll need to utilize a search engine like LUDO or something similar to find them, ETH is quite significant, and we use it on a regular basis for a variety of purposes.    My personal dream is to attempt to realize both ideals at the same time, he added, adding that achieving this aim would require a long time and a lot of effort. However, he pointed out that, in the future, complexity can be reduced.�14�0

It is “only” public testing, but transactions are being validated for the first time. It is working.  Scaling solutions to increase throughput and lower costs will accelerate innovation.  Investor behavior is a vote of confidence – ether (ETH) is being valued as a reserve asset with a high store of value.  The future of finance is being built on Ethereum’s rails. Banks who have entered the digital arena have done so using Ethereum, most notably JP Morgan on its Onyx platform. Public sector trials for bond issuance were also executed using Ethereum, such as the one completed by the European Investment Bank (here). The preference for Ethereum came despite periods of high transaction fees and a long list of challenging upgrades. With the core of those upgrades close to completion, the focus will turn to scale. Why Ethereum? The inertia of its network.  Ethereum was built using an energy-intensive proof-of-work protocol, currently run on the Mainnet chain. A consensus mechanism for proof-of-stake was always on the cards, with the Mainnet chain merging onto the Beacon Chain. This promised a transformative path for the protocol (here). This “Merge” happened last week with live public testing. Real transactions are being validated for the first time (here) with the proof-of-stake mechanism. This is monumental.  The value of a decentralized community is readily apparent in the testing phase. Glitches are being discovered and resolved without any centralized coordination. Work on the protocol is driven by market incentives. Consider the example of Tenderly. It is a platform that develops smart contracts on the Ethereum protocol. Debugging software design is a key element of their activities. They are one of several who have identified issues with the testing of the Merge (here). Others, such as Uniswap, are actively testing. Solutions are being driven by the alignment of network incentives.  Investors are voting with their (digital) wallets.  The successful start of the Merge has increased demand to stake ether (ETH). After the launch of public testing, ether staked on March 15 jumped by the second-highest one-day volume ever. Since then, the pace of staking is the strongest since the initial introduction of the Beacon Chain (Figure 1 here).  Total ether staked is more than 2,000% the target needed to start the process as first determined in November 2021 (here). And the percent of ether staked is still relatively low at 11% compared to 56% for the other top five staking protocols. There is pent-up demand for ether.  There are other technical nuances. The Merge will be a positive liquidity event for ether staked to the Beacon Chain, having been locked with an uncertain timetable. But the timing of the unlock and the forward liquidity profile is still unknown with further upgrades required (here). A longer lockup period could be deemed desirable as a way of rewarding patient providers of staking services and avoiding excessive cyclical swings in staking rates.  One of the most surprising features of ether investors is that they tend to be as patient as bitcoin investors. In fact, the percentage of ether supply held for longer than a one-year period, at 62.3%, is almost identical to that of bitcoin (here). This is not by design. After all, the Ethereum protocol was built as a utility vehicle where ether is used to pay fees to execute transactions; the use case for bitcoin is focused on its store of value. Yet, three factors suggest that ether will maintain its value feature in the digital ecosystem.  First, the protocol survived bottlenecks that were frustrating for users. The stronger the network, the greater the volumes. But this came at a cost of higher and more volatile transaction fees. Ethereum transaction fees peaked at an average of over $60 last year (here). Bullish, longer-term users could neutralize costs by operating more exclusively in the native currency to the Ethereum protocol – ether. After all, the US dollar cost of transactions rises more sharply when ether is in high demand and the protocol is successful. There is an incentive to hold the underlying asset, particularly as it has been re-designed to be limited in new supply. Ether takes the role of a reserve asset.  Second, the merge brings Ethereum scalability into focus. High congestion in the Ethereum protocol led to two alternative solutions – competing layer 1 protocols that promise higher throughput or cooperating layer 2s that operate within the Ethereum ecosystem. Layer 2 scaling protocols surged alongside the increased visibility of the Merge – total locked value rose 4-times to more than $8 billion in the past six months. StarkNet and Polygon are two companies making layer 2 strides (here and here). It is a game-changer for throughput.  Third, ether is being transformed into a low-risk bond asset and it is cheap. The yield from staking generates a real cash flow that is paid in ether. Additional value that is extracted by miners will redirect to staking investors, translating to yields of around 10% in the initial instance (here). It is equivalent to a perpetual bond. It transforms ether into the low-risk asset inside of its ecosystem, like a banking reserve. The two forces of valuation are the bond math – increased ether demand brings lower yields and higher bond prices – and the foreign exchange math – increased network demand to hold ether versus dollars (here). A doubling in the value of ether to $6,000 is a low bar.  The Merge is done. Developers are satisfied. The focus is entirely on a rigorous testing phase to clear the bugs and a conservative three-month window would bring the Merge live in June. The mechanism for satisfying withdrawals of ETH from the Beacon Chain is work-in-progress. Developers are leaning to a ‘push’ approach, far more efficient though a bit slower to implement (here). The unlocking of ETH liquidity will take a bit longer than anticipated but will be worth the wait. Strategic attention turns to scalability. The Merge solidifies Ethereum’s foundation.  The things built on it will be key to users. Recent innovations show that the network is incredibly optimistic (here).  It is increasingly clear that the future of finance runs on Ethereum with ETH as a reserve asset to the ecosystem. It was worth the wait.�2�0

So the more ETH-killers there are, the more they will take up each other's share of the pie.  In the end, none will be able to challenge ETH's dominance!  So more ""ETH-killers"" -> More likely ETH will be dominant  Analogy: Voting with political parties  Imagine there is a dominant political party that consistently wins the majority of the votes.  Ironically, the more opposition parties there are, the more they will compete with each other (resulting in all of them getting lower votes), and the dominant party will benefit from all these competition!  The ""opposition"" would actually stand a better chance if there were only 1 or 2 opposition parties!"�4�0

2022-04-27 14:20:10�ud4pe6�Do you know of any interesting investments online shows?�I didn't know what a Unicorn Company was, I believed it was the name of the company - Unicorn haha.   However, as you are surely aware, in the business world, a unicorn firm is a privately owned startup with a valuation of $1 billion.     An interesting thing I've discovered is that after a new business has achieved unicorn status, it may aim for decacorn status (a $10 billion valuation - there are roughly 30 decacorns in existence) and then hectocorn status - commonly referred to as super unicorn (a $100 billion value).     After watching the business show Unicorn Hunters I became interested in all of these things. I must admit it's extremely intriguing, and you can learn a lot about crypto and all of the new technology we're using in business on a daily basis.     I was so impressed with Unicoin and all of its possibilities that I'm considering investing in it today, especially after learning that Unicoins are being invested in firms with great expansion potential and that the best of these companies may be featured on our Unicorn Hunters show.     I'm looking for more TV shows like this one where you find out more about investing, crypto, etc. Have you watched this one maybe?�13�0

2022-04-27 13:19:33�ud3era�Because technology is advancing, hacking is progressing as well�"I was shocked when I heard about hacking BAYC! It was a huge theft of millions of dollars worth of the simian NFTs. Have you noticed how there are plenty of these hacks these days?      I was just discussing these hacking issues with friends several days ago, cause we ran across some really great blockchain platforms for data protection and have been thinking about how every possible platform and website should be using it. We can all see what's happening since the tech is evolving, hacking is going to the next level as well.     For big companies one of the answers to my concern could be platforms like Modex, they develop scalable products and services that transform the way data and digital assets are stored, shared, and managed using blockchain technology. There are also plenty of systems that work on blockchain but they're provided for regular computer users.     ""The attacker seized control of the BAYC Instagram account and sent a phishing post that many followers were fooled into clicking on, connecting their crypto wallets to the hacker’s “smart contract” – a mechanism for implementing a crypto transaction. That enabled the attacker to steal the assets held in the wallets, seizing control of four Bored Apes, as well as a host of other NFTs with an estimated total value of $3m."" - I this news here.     I was never a huge fan of BAYC but this thing is really upsetting, I was trading some NFTs on several platforms, currently, I'm pausing it while I wait for this upcoming SK8coin project, but after all these things are possible everywhere, not only on super popular platforms such as BAYC (I would even say that hacking huge popular marketplaces and platforms is even tougher) that's why I started searching for some cool solution."�14�0

2022-04-27 10:33:46�ud0gs4�People are furious about these ups and downs when it comes to ETH gas fees, it becomes really annoying�It's never pleasant to learn that the cryptocurrency in which you have invested is underperforming, as you might expect, this is a problem with ETH.  Ethereum is one of the greatest platforms for dApp development, and as a result, many projects have begun on its smart contract. However, its expensive gas is now an increasing source of worry.     I guess that transactions are increasing because the ETH public blockchain has gained widespread success in decentralized processes like DEX, DeFi, and blockchain games which is truth to be said changing the gaming world, just take a look at how many advantages they have now.      So, when you sell and acquire NFTs (you'll almost definitely use Ethereum), for example, NFT in a game, you want to buy some nice digital assets for your racing vehicle on K4 Rally, but the first thing you have to do is buy using ETH coins that these platforms use so you can make future purchases, right?     I am well aware of the sensitivity of the situation, people become furious about these ups and downs when it comes to ETH gas fees, it becomes really annoying. What do you believe is the reason for these swings in gas fees?�10�0

2022-04-27 10:01:09�uczzoj�"When Solana was initially released, it was labeled as an ""Ethereum killer"", do you think that Solana may come up against Ethereum?"�"What do you think about this prediction that Solana may come up against Ethereum? That was a comment made by Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, that I read about today.     It's a horrible time to say something like that because the Ethereum community is furious that their platform is further delaying the Merge. We've all been looking for all sorts of solutions for cheaper gas prices over the years, and I know from personal experience how frustrating it can be until you discover the correct one, which in my case (thank heaven) is Metis.     People referred to Solana as the ""Ethereum killer"" when it was first introduced.     It rose to prominence as a reactive blockchain that filled gaps in the Ethereum blockchain. With a transaction pace of around 60000 per second, Solana is one of the fastest layer-one blockchains. It is a far more efficient, highly scalable, and low-fee blockchain that is still in its early stages.     In comparison, Ethereum not only has a larger NFT marketplace than Solana, but it is also the flagship altcoin and the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It stands out in terms of decentralization and is backed by the extremely efficient Ethereum Foundation. It enables multi-chain networks, which dramatically enhances scalability while maintaining security.     The Merge, the blockchain's hard split, will take place this year. Many members of the Ethereum community are optimistic about it. Do you believe Solana can compete with Ethereum?"�12�0

2022-04-28 19:45:33�ue3g52�"Do you know what ""51% attack"" is?"�"I didn't even hear of this term until a few days ago while we discuss at work cryptocurrencies, so I left speechless, I dunno about what these guys talked about lol.     So, maybe some of you will find this helpful.    A 51% attack is an attack on a blockchain by a group of miners holding more than 50% of a network's mining hash rate which is the total of all computer power committed to mining and processing transactions.     I found this in one article: ""Successful attackers gain the ability to block new transactions from being confirmed as well as change the ordering of new transactions. It also allows the malicious agents to essentially rewrite parts of the blockchain and reverse their own transactions, leading to an issue known as double-spending. This problem was traditionally an issue faced mostly by electronic payments where a network was incapable of proving that two or more people didn’t spend the same digital asset.""     But I was wondering how can you prevent this, does blockchain solutions such as Modex or any of these blockchain data protection platforms can help you with this attack??     What do you think about this problem? I am new to this so if you have any additional information it would be cool to know."�8�0

2022-04-28 18:40:40�ue202j�Track Real-Time ETH Sentiment and Trends across Twitter and Google Trends�Hey Everyone,  Just wanted to share a useful tool to screen for new investment or trading opportunities based on social sentiment trends. The [Social Sentiment Dashboard](https://utradea.com/social-dashboard?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=onesqueezeDD) allows you to track the top trending crypto across Twitter and Stocktitws, and Google Trends  This is useful because if there is strong retail momentum behind crypto we usually see an increase in volume and price action.  **Tracking Mechanics**  * The algorithm pulls data from multiple social platforms. For Twitter, we use the Twitter API. It looks at tweets, comments, likes, and impressions. * The change in these metrics is displayed as well as the underlying posts that feed the dashboard, so you can drill into the individual tweets for transparency and sentiment purposes. * There is also tracking for Stocktwits - though Twitter usually has the largest reach. * Google Trends is interesting because it is a good proxy for the overall interest of a coin  **Trending Overview For ETH**  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/rzafpbx6ebw81.png?width=1458&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b515bade3ccd8dab011fe70a569f5e19e1faaa6  For the metrics listed in the section **Social Sentiment Metrics: Selecting a Metric for the Dashboard** there are three options to select from, and we will use **Posts** as an example:  1. **Posts** \- the number of posts for the selected timeframe 2. **Posts Previous** \- the number of posts for the **previously** selected timeframe 3. **Posts Change** \- the **change** in the number of posts from the previous timeframe to the currently selected timeframe  The metric value, previous metric value, and change in metric value are available **for Posts, Comments, Likes, Impressions, Sentiment, 10K Followers, 100K Followers, and 500K Followers.** [Here is a detailed guide on how to use the dashboard](https://utradea.com/blog/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Stocks-and-Cryptocurrency)  Hopefully, you find this useful. Check it out and let me know what you think, and also consider following our sub [r/utradea](https://www.reddit.com/r/utradea/) to stay up to date with the latest releases.�1�0
2022-04-28 18:23:03�ue1lwv�Have you heard what Cryptojacking is, can we prevent it somehow??�Crypto hacks and frauds happen in a variety of forms. I heard of a variety of hacks, some hackers immediately break into wallets and take money, while others profess to love you and defraud you of your coins, and still, others are so sneaky that you don't even realize your device has been infiltrated.     But I must say that I was unsure what cryptojacking was, so I Googled it and discovered that it is the same as the last form of hacking I mentioned, but I had no idea it was called cryptojacking.      So, cryptojacking is a sort of cyberattack in which hackers use a device's computer capacity to mine bitcoin without the owner's permission. It's terrible cause you are not even aware that's happening.     Did you know that's the sixth most common malware globally? I've been thinking is this possible to protect via some app or platform, like we can use Modex Blockchain Database or similar ones? Can we even protect ourselves with blockchain when it comes to this issue?     When cryptojacking malware infects a device, it seizes control of the device's computational resources and directs a portion of it to mine specific coins. The mined money is then sent to the hacker's wallet.     Since I know now what it is, it would be cool to know how to prevent it.�12�0
2022-04-28 18:15:48�ue1g3f�I used each one, and here's my review of the most well-known prediction market dapps.�There are four prediction market dapps in the world (three of which work), and I will break out and rank them based on my experience using them. They're all non-custodial and allow you to bet in USDC.  &#x200B;  **❌ Augur 0/10**  It doesn’t work. Their v1 failed, v2 failed, and their Augur Turbo/sportsbook has not had a single bet made in over 90 days. They briefly had a Matic grant and saw some very small volume. But since the grant ran out, they have not had anyone using their product.  I tried again to use it today, but there is no one to bet against because there are no other users. The project is dead.  &#x200B;  🥉 **PoltX 5/10**  This prediction market is heavily focused on short-term crypto price betting. You can bet on the price of over ten popular cryptos, which is nice, and there are always markets expiring soon. The max bets are quite small (about $20-$50 on most events) as liquidity seems to be offered only by one party. For sports betting, they only have Indian cricket with similar small limits.  The dapp is good for small bettors looking to bet on crypto prices or if you are a fan of Indian premier league cricket. The dapp is not suitable for whales, people looking to bet over $100 at a time, or general sports bettors.  &#x200B;  🥈 **Polymarket 8/10**  This prediction market is focused on popular culture with markets spanning art, politics, and sports. Most of Polymarket’s betting options are long-dated, meaning they expire weeks or months in the future, and they have cool charts showing the price changes over time. The limits are pretty good on popular markets and often allow people to bet $1,000 without drastically moving the odds. Their sports coverage is not great and will normally include a handful of games each day with the option of choosing the winner.  The dapp is great for intellectually curious traders who want to bet on popular news stories like Elon’s acquisition of Twitter or the winner of the French elections. Their focus is on non-sports prediction markets. I believe it will continue as the market leader in pop culture betting.  &#x200B;  🏆 **SX Bet 9/10**  SX Bet has the strongest sports betting offerings of any prediction market in crypto and – outside Betfair’s football soccer offering – probably the world. Out of the dapps listed here, they are the most popular by total betting volume. Likely, this is because they offer over 500 new markets each day. In contrast to Polymarket, SX Bet focuses on daily sports betting rather than long-dated pop culture markets. Their pop culture offerings are not great but do include Bitcoin and Ethereum price betting markets. One big advantage is that you earn SX tokens as you bet, converting users into platform owners.  While Polymarket is my go-to for pop culture, SX Bet is the best sports prediction market with high limits on North American sports ($25k+ max bets) and $5k max bets on European and Asian sporting events.  &#x200B;  **Tl;Dr**  * Augur is dead * PlotX is in beta, has small limits, and is regionally focused on India * Polymarket is the best option for pop culture and political betting markets * SX Bet is the best option for sports betting and the market leader by volume�120�0
2022-04-28 18:08:15�ue1a52�As Ethereum prepares for Epic Merger which see will the network Move From a Proof -of -Work system to A Proof -of- Stake system. What are the implications of this Move for the Network?�" The second largest cryptocurrecy is set to undergo a merge that would see it go from operating a POW system to a Proof -of - Stake system.   The merge was meant to take effect in June but was postponed.  Brendan Playford, founder and CEO of decentralized financial data platform Masa Finance stating reasons for the postponement said "" it is entirely possible that  Ethereum's much-anticipated switch to a proof-of-stake system may be postponed once more, given how hard the change is and how uncertain it is that it can actually deliver on its promise of cheaper transaction fees and faster transaction speeds.""   Factors such as the speed and processing costs of Ethereum have inspired  the propsed merge . As a proof-of-work blockchain, it can only handle 30 transactions per second, but if it switches to Proof -of - Stake , it plans to execute 100,000 transactions per second.  The proof of stake system works through users where in holders of a particular quantity of ether can deposit it, or stake it, and become a ""validator."" Because these validators stake their own cryptocurrency, they are motivated to do a better job. If they don't, the value of their staked ether begins to fall.   That's why proponents of the proof-of-stake model hail it as a boon for increased security: validators are compelled to maintain the network safe. There will also be fewer ether coins issued, increasing the virtual currency's scarcity.  This will help it to compete with smaller cryptocurrencies like Solana and Cardano, which leverage POS for decentralized finance applications including trading, investing, borrowing, and even non-fungible tokens   In conclusion I think  the Proposed merger holds great benefit for the network as it would increase the platforms efficiency and while also processing  transaction faster.  It would also help the increase the platform's security as the proof of stake system requires validators to maintain the network safe.  This will also make apps and all kinds of running project on it's platform more effective such as MakerDAO  the first decentralized lending protocol in existence, Sandbox is like the metaverse-equivalent of MineCraft in terms of its design and functionality. It like a real estate on the metaverse, Chainlink the first and most successful oracle for Ethereum, Faith tribe a platform for creating trading, distribution, and monetization of designs of fashion, Brave is a new and rapidly growing web browser that it gives its users the option to view ads or not , if users choose to view them, they 'll be rewarded with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) .  Implementing  the merge would no doubt make the apps and network run on Ethereum more effective and encouraging creation of creative newer projects on it's  network.    Also the environmental impact  of this move should  be taken into consideration as the network would need considerably less power to run it's  network."�11�0

2022-04-28 14:53:01�udwtto�Cryptocurrency is going mainstream, are you ready for all these big changes?�Cryptocurrency is going mainstream, as analysts project that the crypto market will grow exponentially over the next few years since cryptocurrencies made huge changes in economics and in every possible sphere and industry.      Big companies are trying to figure out how cryptocurrency fits into their business. So, I was not so surprised when I heard that even Unicorn Hunters (an online investment show) announced Unicoin which is used for investing in hundreds of rising growth enterprises with strong development potential. The best aspect is that income from such investments will be distributed as dividends to all Unicoin holders on a regular basis.     Since crypto is becoming present in our real-life activities, that's how it's no surprise that a crypto is a viable form of payment. Have you heard that PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard have already started allowing clients to purchase and transact crypto through their platforms?     There are various benefits to using cryptocurrency for wages and salaries, particularly for organizations with a multinational workforce. Cryptocurrencies have no borders, which means they may be used to pay employees anywhere around the globe.     How do you feel about the changes brought on by cryptocurrencies? Do they suit you, and do you believe people will quickly adapt to them?�11�0

2022-04-28 14:46:01�udwobd�Will Ethereum price rally to $3,700? These whales believe so�In two scenarios, the price of Ethereum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency and the fuel or so many blockchain project including DAODAO and Faith Tribe suggests a positive advance to $3,700.  If the $3,129 barrier can be turned into support, investors should expect this rise to continue.  The bullish argument for ETH will be invalidated if the daily candlestick closes below $2,439 on a daily basis.  The bulls are back in business, as the price of Ethereum has recovered after a recent slump. The technicals and on-chain measures have converged, indicating that a recovery rally is imminent.   Ethereum price is poised for a reversal. Since September 19, 2021, the price of Ethereum has been developing a massive triple bottom setup. After a 34 percent drop, ETH hit a swing low of $2,652 at the time. This was followed by an 83 percent increase in less than two months, resulting in an all-time high of $4,868.  The market structure of cryptocurrencies eventually worsened, resulting in profit-taking that caused the price of Ethereum to drop by 55 percent and go below the swing low of $2,652 set on September 19, 2021.   These two swing lows point to a probable triple bottom setup on a one-day time frame.   A retest of the $2,652 support level will complete the bottom reversal pattern and set in motion a tremendous rally to the all-time high of $4,868. However, because this change has not yet been verified, investors should bear this in mind.  A bounce off the $2,800 to $3,000 support cluster, followed by a strong rise above the 50-day SMA at $3,035 and the 2022 volume point of control at $3,129, is a more likely scenario for Ethereum price.  The bulls' strength and intentions to push higher will be revealed by a daily candlestick close above the aforementioned resistance levels. In this instance, ETH may gain 13% to $3,476 to retest the 200-day SMA.   It's worth mentioning that the price of ETH might rise much further, filling the low-volume node at $3,703, bringing the total run-up to 25% from its current position of $2,990. A retest of $4,000, while unlikely, could form a local top for Ethereum's price.  The accumulating tendency of whales holding 10,000 to 100,000 ETH supports the optimistic outlook. This group of investors has a history of buying the dips, which has resulted in huge profits.   As prices fell from around $4,000 to $2,700 in September 2021, these wallets boosted their holdings from 25.07 percent to 26.25 percent of Ether's circulating supply. Similar to the existing downswing, buy-the-dip tendencies can be seen between late December 2021 and early January 2022.   The recent downturn appears to have served as a buy signal for whales, who boosted their holdings by 1.94 percent, indicating that the price of Ethereum is likely to rise.  The increase in the volume of ETH outflows from trading platforms shown in the exchange net position change indicator adds to this positive picture. This indicator measures the outflow of ETH over the last 30 days and reveals that approximately 1.5 million ETH has left centralized entities' wallets as of April 13, indicating strong institutional investor confidence and a significant drop in sell-side pressure.   In the whole history of Ethereum, such a huge outflow has only happened six times.  While the technicals and on-chain metrics point to a bullish future, the first option, referred to as the triple bottom configuration, has a far more reliable conclusion, whereas the second option, in which Ethereum price continues to rally from its current position, will most likely be a short-term uptrend.   A decisive daily candlestick close below $2,439, regardless of whatever scenario occurs, will result in a lower low from a high time frame standpoint, invalidating the bullish thesis.   In this event, the bears may seize control and trigger a 30% drop to $1,706, allowing market makers to recover sell-stop liquidity from traders who began long positions in July 2021.�12�0

2022-04-28 13:42:05�udva97�I'm really pleased with how blockchain tech is developing and I believe that protection will be even so much better in the near future�Data is rapidly becoming one of the world's most precious resources. Data-centric corporations such as Facebook, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon currently dominate the list of the top ten companies by market value. That number indicates that your data, particularly sensitive data, is now a prominent target for hackers, and we're probably not as safe as you believe.     Would you consider blockchain as an alternative to this issue?     People become so worried about their personal data, which includes any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject). It's cool that we have now solutions and answers to these problems, I was even pretty amazed when I figure out that even any sort of files we have (pdf, jpg, or even video files) can be converted into smart data thanks to the Zenotta blockchain.     But as we have even that as a solution for our personal files and data we leave by simply doing some Google research, how is it possible that huge companies and projects such as BAYC or Axie Infinity get hacked?      I am aware that as the tech and solutions to hacks are evolving, hackers are evolving as well, but I somehow expect that these companies are secured like really really good. Anyway, I'm really pleased with how blockchain tech is developing and I believe that protection will be even so much better in the near future.�10�0

2022-04-28 12:11:23�udtj3f�Pros and Cons of browser-based NFT games?� What are your thoughts on the benefits and drawbacks of browser-based NFT games?  I know most of you grew up playing browser-based games like Club Penguin, Y8, Newgrounds…., and more. One thing I like about it is that you don't have to download them, which saves you some storage space, but one of the cons is that the games sometimes take a long time to load or crash before you can even play specifically, Metawars. Also, the quality would be different, which I know is one of the reasons why some of you dislike NFT games. What games are you currently playing? And how is it so far? Is it better if I opt for games that can be played on your phone or if you have to first download them on your computer? I’m looking forward to playing a bunch of games like Ethermon and k4 Rally and I’m looking for more.�109�0

Do you think that they will continue to postpone launching?�Hey guys,   I'm concerned since I've read in a couple of articles that the Ethereum price is now experiencing big downtrends. What are your opinions on the matter? Cryptocurrencies have ups and downs, and this is how I perceive the Ethereum situation. I can't stand the idea that this is the end of Ethereum, right?     Another thing that's not so clear to me is as we all noticed that all the cryptocurrencies are correlated with each other, why is that? Why whenever ETH goes down whenever BTC does?     Ethereum has been on a downtrend in 2022, then we've got these enormous gas fees that we're I dunno even how dealing it (thank god for L2 solutions and Metis lol) and we have to deal with these type of news as well.     The ETH token has crossed the US$4,000 resistance level, providing investors strong optimism for the token's future possibilities, but now, the Ethereum token is having a hard time crossing the US$3,000 resistance.       Does that worry you? How do you think that things will end for ETH since they delay Ethereum’s upgrade that is postponed to be launched in the Q3 of 2022? Do you think that they will continue to postpone launching?�7�0

2022-04-29 16:53:54�ueq9m6�In my opinion, NFT tickets are a great solution for all possible scams and scalping�"Tickets are now a direct contact between the artists or performances and the fans thanks to NFTs. Major ticketing services are using blockchain technology in particular to deliver digital tickets, special discounts, updates, and more to event attendees.     Let's imagine you have a strong desire to attend a concert. However, by the time you find out about it, it has already sold out, and the scalped tickets would be available on the secondary market, sometimes known as the ""black market."" Ticket scalpers purchase a large number of sports and entertainment event tickets with the intention of reselling them for a significant profit above the original purchase price.     It would be smart to look out for NFT ticketing platforms such as NFT TiX for example because these types of marketplaces eliminate all these problems you can have with standard tickets we're buying and this would be certainly the future of the ticketing system. It eliminates the need for a physical ticket and connects users directly to the NFT ticketing marketplace.     Do you think that this would be the answer to all these fraud/scalpings and black-market issues that event organizers are dealing with?"�10�0

2022-04-29 16:49:23�ueq652�How can some people believe that cryptocurrency and the metaverse are the future when a large part of the population is unaware of any of this?�"Are you aware that most people have no clue about cryptocurrencies and that cryptocurrencies are not accepted everywhere?      I was never even thinking about this and I must say that I wasn't even aware that we who are interested in crypto are actually a smaller group of people compared to the group of people who don't have a clue about crypto, which is very strange when you think about it.     I figure that out the other day when I was talking about a few people and talking about how excited I was when I heard about Unicoin and some blockchain projects that blew my mind, this guy, my age was so confused. It was like I talked in some foreign language lol. He heard of it but he doesn't know anything about it.     Here on Reddit, we have our ""bubble"", our community where we can share our enthusiasm about it, but somehow we forget that many people don't have any interest in it or knowledge and I don't mean by that older people, there are different age who use the internet as well and many of them are not interested in it cause they consider it nonsense.     So, I'm curious how some people believe that cryptocurrencies are the future, metaverse as well when we have a huge percentage of people who are not interested in it? Maybe all of that would be possible in 100 years lol."�9�0

2022-04-29 14:42:55�uengau�Different crypto metaverse projects everywhere. Which one are you looking forward to?�" A lot of metaverse projects are springing up, similar to P2E games.    [Decentraland](https://www.reddit.com/r/decentraland/): As to what I understand, Decentraland is more focusing on virtual lands. Decentraland also includes a marketplace and a drag-and-drop editor that players can use to create scenes. The only downside to this is, You can only buy lands within their marketplace. But even so, decentraland can be played on your browser for free.   [Kirin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kirin_Official/): has a similar function called ""no-code"" full suite studio like sandbox (not sure if sandbox’s tool is a no-code too.) You can build, buy, or import anything while being able to use it like any social media site such as Facebook and Twitter where apparently, “nothing is off limits” (idk about that though.). It is also multi-chain and interoperable. In comparison to decentraland, their own automated market maker will have a Uniswap V2 compatible interface which is pretty neat.   [Sandbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandbox/): like Decentraland,  a lot of people already know this.  Sandbox includes a variety of tools, such as an NFT and game maker, as well as intriguing artistic visuals. I prefer the graphics of Sandbox than Decentraland. It's also completely free to play! and btw. Snoop Dogg is a well known buyer of lands on sandbox.    [Star atlas](https://reddit.com/r/StarAtlas/): out of these four, star atlas can be played through VR. When watching the trailer it feels like it’s too good to be true. Aside from being space travelers, players are considered Star Atlas citizens who are free to pursue their professional interests since I think there’s a script that we need to follow or something."�122�0

What are your expectations? Are you excited?     As the hype surrounding Ethereum's huge update grows, it's important to remember that it won't instantly fix some of the chain's most significant problems. That also applies to gas fees, sadly, this will have no effect on gas fees, but I believe that every one of us has already found a solution for this through all of these L2 platforms such as Loopering, Metis, and so on.     But I heard so many great things that will improve, it also includes that Ethereum will become more environmentally friendly thanks to the shift of Ethereum from the energy-consuming proof-of-work verification mechanism to the proof-of-stake one.     It's cool to see how many people are optimistic about this upgrade, including billionaire and investor Mark Cuban (Dallas Mavericks). Apart from making it a greener cryptocurrency, this update will limit the coin's circulating supply since fewer Ethers will be generated using PoS.     Are you looking forward to this Ethereum's major upgrade?�17�0

2022-04-29 12:26:23�ueksns�What do you think about how the future of NFTs will empower artists?�We all know that NFT art is taking over the world, and the future of NFTs will give more power to artists. Although I think that artists (of any kind) should have been always as popular and respected as they are today, I am glad that NFTs have encouraged people to be more interested in art and their creators and to appreciate them more.     NFT art is fast altering how artists are compensated and revolutionizing how NFT artists may work, establish new projects, and claim ownership of their art.     I love the idea how thanks to NFTs there's raising awareness of some important issues and they can be a powerful thing for women, and women of color, everyone can tell their story thanks to them.     We should stop seeing NFTs as some interesting pics that can be worth a fortune, that was maybe in the beginning but using them in a good way can make really great things, so much more than some cool pic.      I love even how all these groups that cherish some hobby together are having their NFT communities and groups, SK8coin is one of them, an upcoming project for skateboarding fans, promoting skateboarding, street art, street fashion, everything that has something with skating and it's gathering all the people who share an interest in it. That's pretty awesome.     NFTs aren't anymore about having a cool NFT profile pic, now you could use it to help to create communities that can help teach or learn or be creative in so many other ways.     For an artist, NFT is a tool that can change their life and I think this is only the beginning, cause NFTs are going to reshape the internet as we know it now. What do you think about all that?�8�0

However, people sell for all different reasons. For example, if you’ve lost conviction in a company, it might make sense to move your money elsewhere.�4�0

2022-04-30 20:59:14�ufjxtc�I can't wait for NFT tickets to go on sale worldwide�I notice that more and more performers are interested in NFT tickets and are starting to offer their fans to buy them as well, which I believe is not a trend but will become something which we will use regularly in the future as a replacement for tickets we have now.     The producers behind Fortress Festival have launched DeFy Tickets, a new NFT blockchain ticketing platform. Available to United States ticket buyers, DeFy offers digital smart tickets that can be bought and sold as NFTs on the Polygon Blockchain.     What I really find cool when it comes to NFT tickets is that they allow artists to prevent the loss of revenue that occurs via the secondary market. That's a possibility for technology to create a more fair, transparent, and secure distribution of value to event organizers, artists, and fans. NFT TiX is really trying to bring close these new ways of ticketing to users and I truly hope that we will all get used to this ticketing system as soon as possible.      Lupe Fiasco and Gucci Mane are selling tickets to their upcoming concerts as NFTs, it would be even more and more artists who will join them, can't wait for this to become global.�21�0

2022-04-30 20:45:42�ufjo9w�I am amazed how blockchain technology has the ability to modify many aspects of business, government, and even our personal life�Not only banking and healthcare, but blockchain technology has the ability to modify many aspects of business, government, and even our personal life.  Selecting the right blockchain is important here, I've seen that many businesses are now depending on Modex Blockchain Database. According to what I've heard, they've been in business since 2017, which makes them trustworthy, and individuals have had positive experiences with them.  Blockchains are not all the same. If the consensus mechanism is not entirely decentralized, or if full nodes have the power to reverse or censor transactions, the same concerns as in traditional systems will arise.  In my opinion, standards must also be defined because there are now numerous distinct blockchain protocols competing with one another.  Do you have any firsthand experience with these systems that can help protect our data using blockchain that you can share with us?�18�0
2022-04-30 20:14:05�ufj2ly�Who knows how many of these new coins and cryptocurrencies that appear on a daily basis will gain popularity�Did you know that according to Deutsche Bank, digital currencies will have over 200 million users by 2030? What are your thoughts about that?     I don't think it's a surprise, given that there are more and more crypto holders every day, and, believe it or not, additional cryptocurrencies are being released every month.     According to Deutsche Bank, the number of cryptocurrency users will more than double in the next ten years, reaching 200 million. This rate of growth is nearly identical to that of the Internet in its first 20 years.     I had no clue hundreds of new cryptocurrencies, whether altcoins or tokens, were produced every month!      I just googled new cryptocurrencies this month, and there are a lot of them.  I was shocked to learn about Unicoin this month since I had heard that they should be invested in hundreds of emerging growth firms with significant development potential, and that is how the holders' profit.     Who knows how many of these new coins and cryptocurrencies that appear on a daily basis will gain popularity. Isn't it true that time will tell?�20�0

I would like to see these numbers swapped so honey swap providers get 400k and uniswap providers get 200k.

2022-04-30 12:58:28�ufakmp�I've seen that a growing number of businesses are already accepting ETH payments�I began to consider what we might buy with ETH because there are so many projects and businesses that now accept this type of payment.     Ethereum was established with the intention of stressing smart contracts and decentralized, self-executing agreements incorporated in the network itself.     Every one of these potential advantages is accessible with ETH, and I've seen that a growing number of businesses are already accepting ETH payments.     When it comes to NFTs, we may buy them with ETH and use them to pay for other services provided by other projects and markets, such as SK8coin or any other that accepts ETH.     Must mention that I did not use ETH to directly pay for anything. When we take a closer look, we can see that we are already using ETH to pay for a range of things, even when we exclude the tokens we purchase for future payments.     Would you use it to purchase NFTs or to pay for products or services? Do you believe that Ethereum will be utilized on a daily basis in the near future?�17�0

2022-04-30 12:22:54�ufa05d�Would you say that the art NFT economy will be huge?�It's terrible that, with the advent of the internet, where anything can be copied and pasted without the creator's permission, we as people have allowed artwork to languish for so long.     On the other hand, NFTs help artists overcome this critical issue by ensuring ownership of each digital production - an NFT owner owns just the token itself, not the underlying item or any related copyright.     Whether you believe the hype or not, NFTs are going to change the art industry, affecting not just how art is acquired and sold, but also what kind of art we value and whose artists we support.     NFT markets are the answer to making NFT artworks. Users may mint NFT by uploading their digital artwork to the marketplace site.     Would you believe that NFTs will alter the current art market trading mechanism, particularly for digital art?     Yet, of course, there are many different kinds of marketplaces. Because I've been skating my entire life, I'd absolutely put my NFT on a Sk8coin if it had anything to do with skateboarding. They assist skaters, sports teams, artists, and others. As you can see, there are a variety of options for minting and submitting your NFT artwork.     Would you say that the art NFT economy will be huge?�17�0

2022-04-30 12:06:00�uf9qlj�While it may be difficult to avoid using the internet, how can you protect your privacy and safety?�The Internet evolved so quickly that we now have access to everything conceivable, and there are no limitations. Can we, however, always rely on the administrator or other users of the Internet network service provider that we use?     There have been several malversations and thefts, particularly since the popularity of cryptocurrencies began to rise, and we must secure our data and exercise extreme caution.     Of course, with the advent of the IT and crypto sectors, we now have solutions to our concerns. I'm now using Zenotta and I can say that I feel safer, but it's frightening how many average customers get their info hijacked, it's terrible.     The threat to Internet security is a key hurdle to electronic transactions through the Internet medium.     Many CEOs are puzzled by the current popularity and possible profitability of internet commerce. Connecting to the Internet and expanding their business would, in other words, expose them to dangers and threats of invasion. On the other hand, being disconnected from the Internet would mean losing communication with consumers and services to competitors.     Therefore, while it's tough to stop surfing the internet, how can you ensure your privacy and safety? What is your long-term plan?�17�0

2022-04-30 10:20:37�uf8agm�Dealing with high gas prices and delayed transactions may be critical for all of these newcomers who are getting to know Ethereum�The Ethereum chain has battled with limited scalability, decentralization, and a high gas fee. This was the first chain to incorporate smart contracts, and it is still the largest open-source platform for decentralized apps.      ETH is used for every possible transaction, whether we're directly paying with ETH or purchasing some of these tokens that give us additional payment for marketplaces.     So, dealing with high gas prices and delayed transactions is crucial from the start. Do you recall when the Ethereum gas fee once hit $50?     I remember when I first started using ETH, I had no clue about any of these issues, and I was pretty frustrated at first until I started looking for these L2 solutions or applications that analyze the pending transactions on the mainnet Ethererum, and now I use Metis, which helped me a lot.     Although, things are starting to improve, and as you are all aware, ETH now has a variety of big rivals as a result of fundamental ETH flaws that some consumers can no longer handle. How are you dealing with these gas issues?�18�0

If we accept we can’t time the market and on balance it is better to just be in the market for the long term then is DCA bad advice?   Does it make even less sense when inflation is just eating away at your dollars that you have sidelined to DCA?  Seems to me you just decide how much you want to invest and then choose a point where you say you are all in. On average, you are likely to buy higher with DCA as the long-term trend is up….   Is DCA simply a way to cater for loss aversion. We are happy to buy higher  than we are to see price go down after we bought.  Just a poorly formed thought and am keen to hear why I am incorrect.�5�0

2022-05-02 15:42:50�ugshzp�How Yuga Labs could have leveraged Polygon and Bid-to-Earn technology to host the biggest, least-FUDded mint in the history of NFTs, while still remaining on Ethereum�Everyone knows Ethereum gas wars are a nightmare. Still, most brands that established themselves on Ethereum don’t want to go anywhere. Ethereum is still where the money is, after all.  But, what if you could have the best of both worlds?  Here’s how Yuga Labs could have held a huge land sale that takes place on Polygon, but still settles on Ethereum:  **Step 1: Map the Ape token onto Polygon**  Difficulty: Easy, just reach out to the Polygon team.  Cost: Nothing  **Step 2: Deploy ALL of the ERC721 NFTs for sale on Ethereum, with all final metadata (not including reveal)**   Difficulty: Medium  Cost: A few dozen ETH (chimp change for Yuga Labs)  **Step 3: Deploy an equivalent NFT contract with limited metadata (just tokenID). Then map your Ethereum NFT contract to the Polygon ERC721 token contract.**  Difficulty: Easy  Cost: Basically Nothing  **Step 4: Bridge 100% of your NFTs to Polygon, locking them in the bridging contract, and minting them onto Polygon.**   You now have an Otherside land collection on Polygon!  Difficulty: Easy  Cost: A few dozen ETH  **Step 5: Deploy your sale contract onto Polygon.**  This Could be a dutch auction or a normal First come first serve sale.   Personally, we at Aavegotchi recommend a bid-to-earn auction, leveraging GBM's fantastic technology (no hyperlink here due to spam filters, but look up “GBM Auction”  Difficulty: Medium-Advanced  Cost: Basically Nothing  **Step 6: Encourage APE holders to bridge funds to Polygon.**   Explain to them that NFTs still remain on Ethereum. You’re just holding the sale on Polygon so users don't lose 100M in ETH gas fees. Maybe offer some incentives.  Difficulty: Medium  Cost: Bridge fees for users  **Step 7: Now that APE is on Polygon, hold the sale.**   Users win items without spending 2 ETH in gas fees.   Once the sale is over, users can easily bridge their tokens back to Ethereum and claim them for < 0.1 ETH.  \- Minted on Ethereum  \- Sold on Polygon  \- Claimed on Ethereum  ...and that’s how you hold the world’s biggest NFT drop on Polygon, while still settling the NFTs on Ethereum, the value layer.   Or you can blame Ethereum and waste 150M USD worth of gas.�10�0

We now have so many cryptocurrencies that I was shocked when I find out that every day there are plenty of new ones.     So, I think that's not so shocking that 80% of major investors see a bright future for cryptocurrencies? Would you agree with them?     I believe that cryptocurrencies will be used in many enterprises, and we can already see them nearly everywhere.     I was shocked to learn that you can now invest Unicoins in firms with great expansion potential (Unicorn enterprises) and profit from them. Who knows what we will do with cryptocurrencies in the near future.     I've often wondered how people decide on certain projects or currencies to invest in. Do you listen to your inner voice or use your mind to make strategic decisions?     Eighty percent of the larger investor group believes that investments in crypto would outperform traditional investing alternatives within a decade, and 75 percent of ordinary investors agreed with that timescale. Do you share their opinion?�11�0

2022-05-02 09:52:10�ugm2cr�I was wondering if you could play these NFT-powered games if you have no knowledge of cryptocurrencies or investment�Would you say that these NFT-powered games or GameFi is made up of a young audience of gamers aged 19 to 30 years old? I've heard this in some interviews this statement and I couldn't agree with that cause in these games we have the popular GameFi tokens, which are exchanged for billions of dollars every day, are of interest not just to young people, but also to expert cryptocurrency traders.     Ofc that I was so happy discovering all these types of games, from racing games like K4 Rally to card games such as Splinterlands first of all because of the gameplay, but truth to be told the idea of ​​making money playing games is understandably popular for game developers and players alike.     Do you believe that these kinds of games may be a useful investment tool for everyone?     Because we have multiple groups of individuals playing it, for starters, young gamers frequently earn and spend money while playing, assuring token circulation and demand. When it comes to market specialists, earn money by speculating on exchange rates, whereas investors invest in debt.     I was wondering what if you don't have any experience with cryptocurrency or investing, can you be able to play these games? Maybe people without any experience can find it difficult to play these games, what do you think?�11�0

2022-05-02 09:07:48�uglhgy�I recall how we didn't have as many tools and platforms to help us with some of the challenges we were dealing with, now is a whole different story�What prompted you to begin investing in cryptocurrencies, and when did you begin? I'm curious because, as we went to cryptocurrency adoption, everything started popping up out of nowhere: crypto, metaverse, NFT, and in started to pop out in our everyday conversations, on the TV, media, etc.     Did someone have an impact on your decision to start working with cryptocurrencies?      Do you remember when ETH was not worth much a few years ago? I must admit that I didn't expect anything exceptional to happen, and I was surprised how all happened suddenly. I'm glad that day a few years ago I began researching cryptocurrencies more thoroughly.     I remember how we didn't have so many tools and platforms that will help us with some issues we were dealing with, today is totally different story.     I'm looking these days for a platform that will enable me to reduce prices, and fees, speed up transactions, and, of course, ensure that everything is in place.      I've heard a few suggestions and seen on Reddit that some people suggest using a platform called Metis for this purpose. Do you have any prior experience with It?     Most of us here work with cryptocurrencies and devote significant attention to them. I'd want to find a high-quality platform that would improve and simplify a variety of tasks.

Once you’ve created a digital wallet with a seed phrase, you’re ready to purchase a trading card pack from an online retail storefront or a secondary market.  Where Can You Buy NFT Packs?  NFT packs have grown in popularity. Large sporting brands such as the NFL, UFC, NBA, and MLB have introduced these digital collectible trading cards to lifelong fans.   1. NFT Marketplaces   Some brands partner with a secondary marketplace like Atomic Hub using the WAX Blockchain to introduce these NFTs to their audience.   * Spider-Man NFTs  * Funko NFTs  * Nickelodeon NFTs   2. Branded Online NFT Websites   Most brands in the nft space are creating their nft marketplaces, creating online stores to purchase non-fungible tokens directly. Here are a few examples:   UFC NFTs   For the first time, the UFC professional mixed martial arts team collaborates with crypto.com to launch nfts. Allows you to gather NFTs of championship fighters and UFC event contenders. Over 200,000 UFC digital packs were distributed, with the first round distributing approximately 100,000. After you’ve opened the nft Pack, you may also sell these sports trading cards on their marketplace.  NFL NFTs   NFT All Day has moments,’ which are video snippets, photographs, and audio of professional football players on game days that have been turned into non-fungible digital collectibles. These collections contain all of the top plays and highlights from each team’s season. Email, social media, and Discord are used to advertise NFL All Day drops.  Basketball NFTs   NBA Top Shop chronicles historical moments of the NBA’s best talents. These trading cards are available in a variety of media, including photos, video, and audio. The majority of branded enterprises are establishing an online shop to sell these digital artifacts over the blockchain.  How To Open an NFT pack On The Blockchain   These packets don’t have to be difficult to open. Some digital packs have a time limit on when they are accessible to open.  For example, if a drop occurs at 1 p.m. EST and you make a purchase within that period, they may need you to wait until 5 p.m. EST before you may open it. These time constraints assist to build buzz and allow flippers to sell an nft pack at a premium on a third-party site before it opens.  The following are the processes for creating a blockchain-based digital trading card pack:  1. Opening Topps trading cards, go to ‘Unopened Packs’ in your account. 2. Click on the nft Pack you would like to open, and a window pops up asking to ‘confirm’ you’d like to open it. *It’s essential during this step to be entirely sure that you are ready to open a pack because once you open it, you won’t be able to close it.*  3. Click ‘open,’ and the animation will begin showing the trading card pack opening. It will now convert that digital asset from 1 pack to the number of cards available within each Pack.   If you’ve enjoyed reading about nft projects, you may also enjoy:   [**Promote Your NFT collection best 10 free and paid ways**](https://nifty-world.io/promote-your-nft-collection-best-10-free-and-paid/)  [**What NFT Staking All About And Best Platforms For Staking NFT**](https://nifty-world.io/nft-staking-explained-best-nft-staking-platforms/)  [**10 Best upcoming NFT websites to promote your NFT free & paid**](https://nifty-world.io/10-best-upcoming-nft-websites-to-promote-your-nft/)�1�0

2022-05-03 14:53:43�uhhvi5�[Governance Poll] Switch Liquidity Incentive Bonuses for Honeyswap and Uniswap�The Goal of this Governance post is to swap the bonus incentives awarded to those who provide liquidity for the Donut-Dai pair and Donut-ETH pair on Honeyswap and Uniswap respectively.  As all new donuts will be distributed via the Gnosis(xdai) chain more and more liquidity will be getting added to the honeyswap pool thinning out the overall bonus for those providing liquidity on the chain that is already lower than the Uniswap bonus. Currently Uniswap LP providers who stake their donuts get 400k bonus donuts while honeyswap LP providers only get 200k bonus donuts. I would like to see these numbers swapped so honeyswap providers get 400k and uniswap providers get 200k. This would further incentivize people to use their newly acquired donuts to provide LP as all tokens are now distributed on gnosis and learn more about how defi works in the process.  **Poll: The poll can be found on Snapshot** [**https://snapshot.org/#/ethtraderdao.eth/proposal/0x6d8f183b5d6a70febe23058183524c35facaedc77543ba3a8bb985f13289f224**](https://snapshot.org/#/ethtraderdao.eth/proposal/0x6d8f183b5d6a70febe23058183524c35facaedc77543ba3a8bb985f13289f224)   Should we swap the monthly Liquidity providing bonuses for Uniswap(400k) and Honeyswap(200k) donut LP providing  1.\[Yes\] Swap the Uniswap and Honeyswap LP providing bonus incentives  2. \[No\] Remain as is for LP bonus incentives  3. \[Abstain\] You are indifferent  **Poll proposal discussion** [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/ufe0nn/poll\_proposal\_switch\_liquidity\_incentive\_bonuses/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/ufe0nn/poll_proposal_switch_liquidity_incentive_bonuses/)  For Transparency purposes I currently own 0.195% of the dai-Donut liquidity pool.   **This governance poll will remain up for a minimum of 5 days per \[governance guidelines\](**[**https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance)**).

2022-05-03 10:37:22�uhd6rc�Do you know that some airlines are getting involved in blockchain?�Blockchain tech is becoming more popular since it can provide security to so many businesses and make so many things easier to handle.     We already know that certain projects, such as Modex, provide companies with their blockchain, which secures firms' data and information due to blockchain technology. This is why using blockchain in all of these domains and enterprises has become necessary these days.     Now, blockchain become very popular and useful to airlines. I've read that a handful of other airlines are experimenting with the introduction of blockchain technology in their loyalty programs. I think that can be very interesting for their clients and it could be a great way to promote the airline.     That's how Singapore Airlines has been enhancing and expanding its blockchain-based rewards for its clients. I've even read that thanks to blockchain some airlines started selling NFT tickets for their flight and services.      There are so many options in business if you're using blockchain tech, I always find it very inspiring to learn about all the possibilities of blockchain.�9�0

2022-05-03 10:30:13�uhd35z�What would you say is the most difficult part when it comes to deciding what should you invest in next?�"I find myself sometimes pretty confused about what next should I invest in, so I've been curious to find out how you decide what's the best thing for you to invest in.     Have you ever found yourself asking, ""Should I be investing in Ethereum?"" or ""Should I invest in meme coins?"" Or perhaps you've already invested in some and aren't sure what to do next? It occurred to me a few times, and these queries simply lead to further thought and confusion.     The worst part is that we have is the fact that the crypto industry is constantly changing. Traders’ interests change, infrastructure changes, and a coin can be immensely popular one day and disappear the next.     I'm currently interested so much in Unicoins which would be invested in companies with great expansion potential and the best of these companies may be featured on our Unicorn Hunters show. If you watch it then you'll know how cool that show is. I'm keeping an eye on these coins and I hope that I'll soon decide what should I do, but I must admit that I'm pretty interested so far.     You all know that there are numerous options available and that might be challenging at times. Especially when numerous altcoins are aiming to achieve the same thing or have ideas so large that they will take decades to fully comprehend.     How long does it take for you to decide in which crypto to invest, do you observe it for some time first or you're willing to take a risk without any previous research?"�10�0

2022-05-03 09:20:47�uhc59d�The latest report on NFTs claims that the NFT sector is projected to move around $800 billion over the next 2 years, do you think it's possible?�Have you heard about the latest report on NFTs that claims that the NFT sector is projected to move around $800 billion over the next 2 years? Do you think it's possible?  I wouldn't be surprised if the amount would be even bigger since the popularity of NFTs in games is enormous and there are more and more of these games, as there are more and more NFT projects and platforms.  As I'm currently waiting for the SK8coin NFT project to come up I believe that every one of you is expecting some NFT project or collection to show up, so that tells you that there would be even more NFTs than we could imagine.  You can see from the pic below that gaming NFTs are the most common type of NFT to be owned and after gaming, there are profile pics, art, and others.  I can't understand how some people think that NFTs are just a trend, games are built with the NFTs as the main assets, digital artists are finally having a strong money-making tool in their hands, celebrities and powerful people are going crazy about them and there's an even greater cause, there are plenty of good things that NFT can provide to other people because it's been used in humanitarian causes as well.  So, would you still say it's just a trend? I don't think so.  https://preview.redd.it/sznfoarkc8x81.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba3c576d741260eb4d5f53352bb293c656fdfc2f�10�0

2022-05-03 08:50:10�uhbqjq�What do you think of mass adoption of blockchain tech?�"Blockchain originally appeared in the world as the Distributed Ledger Technology that supported the first Bitcoin transactions, which were carried out by Satoshi Nakamoto himself.       Blockchain development has evolved by leaps and bounds, becoming the foundation of multiple markets as well as its own industry. The rise of blockchain developer enterprises, which come out of nowhere, underlines blockchain technology's promise.       After understanding all about these thefts and attacks on personal data and files, as well as how blockchain might help solve these problems, I got more interested in Zenotta's ""Smart Data,"" which is likely one of the best solutions to this problem. With it, any type of file may be converted into ""Smart Data,"" and you as the owner have total control over your digital assets, providing you with protection.       That's why many people believe that the next step for resolving this data theft issue is that there should happen the mass adoption of blockchain technology, which includes that every company should have blockchain as protection from data and personal information theft.       What do you think of the mass adoption of blockchain tech? I think that only time will tell whether the promises made by large Blockchain developer companies will come true and mass adoption will occur."�9�0

2022-05-03 08:13:19�uhb9vc�Do you believe GameFi is introducing us to a new form of playing games, and that conventional video games will be phased out soon?�I've asked myself this a couple of times since there's a lot of buzz about GameFi and new methods of playing video games, people become fascinated with them, and I've seen kids using these VR headsets for playing games more and more, it's so different from playing games when I was a kid.     Even some major video game developers and publishers are entering the NFT industry with NFT games or reintroducing games that we have been playing for decades as NFT games.     I understand that everything evolves and changes with time, which is OK, but does this imply that we will soon lose the video games we have enjoyed for so long?     What do you think about that, are you okay with having only NFT-powered/p2e games?     I didn't say I didn't like these games, cause K4 Rally is my favorite, and the gameplay, rewards, tournaments, everything about it is fantastic and I truly like it, but that doesn't mean I'd like Dota 2, which I've been playing since I was a kid, to become an NFT-powered game, no way! So I understand why players are opposed to this notion, they are undoubtedly concerned that it would transform gaming from its roots.     Do you think that's possible? Would you be okay with it?�10�0

2022-05-03 07:28:06�uhaoov�Do you think that BAYC will have their own blockchain after this debacle with Ethereum's enormous gas fees?�I think that it never happened before that buyers paid more than $100 million as fees in the first few hours of the mint on.     So you might have read that users had to pay thousands of dollars in Ethereum fees to get an NFT that might be worth a few bucks. That happened that day, I saw that someone pay a $3500 transaction fee for a $500 NFT.     I was shocked when I heard that the mint raked in more than $317 million for the company. It sold 55,000 NFTs at a flat price of 305 ApeCoins ($5,800 at the time of mint).     I use Metis for quicker transactions and reduced gas prices and it's awesome, but this...This was a kinda different problem.     Are some of you one of these people who had the misfortune to be at the wrong place at the wrong time?     The overall process put a significant strain on the Ethereum network, which processed these transactions, driving increasing transaction prices for all projects on this blockchain. Some people were forced to pay hundreds of dollars for transactions worth only a few pennies apiece.     Many people believed that Yuga Labs might have created a more effective smart contract to save costs after witnessing high gas prices. However, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin stated that even if Yuga Labs had improved the smart contracts, users would have paid more for NFTs.     It's interesting in this whole story that the company also mentioned that it might look to migrate ApeCoins to its blockchain. What do you think about this, is this a good idea and do you think that will happen?�11�0

I'll continue to stack, stake and HODL ETH to the richest!!! GLTA!!!�Ethereum price to reverse the trend   Ethereum price is in a medium-term ascending channel created by connecting its two higher highs and three higher lows since January 28.   The third retest of the lower trend line has shown a bullish reaction – lead cryptocurrency  BTC is recovering and influencing the rest of the market. Regardless of the bullishness, ETH needs to flip the 100-day SMA at $2,914 followed by the 50-day SMA at $3,069 to continue rising. This development is key to triggering a move that tags the 200-day SMA at $3,443.  While a move to $3,500 is likely, a surge in buying pressure could extend the run-up to the $4,000 psychological level.  On the other hand, a daily candlestick close below the weekly support level at $2,541 will indicate a resurgence of selling pressure and invalidate the bullish thesis. This could trigger a further crash to the $2,000 psychological level.  By: Akash Girimath, FXStreet  &#x200B;  [We just got a huge surge in all risk-assets. ETH up +6.67&#37; today after the Fed announced a 50 basis point increase in the Federal Funds rate. I'm currently long-term 139.085+ ETH, 135 ETH staked and HODL to year 2028!!!

2022-05-04 14:42:12�ui85o1�What is Tokemak TOKE? Everything You Need to Know�Liquidity is the lifeblood of markets. Without it, it would be impossible to buy or sell anything of value. A market is only as healthy as the amount of liquidity it has available to it. Tokemak is a new type of DeFi platform specifically designed to create deep liquidity reservoirs and fuel the future of Web3 development. It defines itself on its website as a “decentralized market maker” and “liquidity router”, offering projects a simpler and more efficient way to source liquidity.   Tokemak is often referred to as a “Defi 2.0” project. DeFi 2.0 is not an official term, but is a colloquial term used by many in the community to differentiate between approaches. Traditionally, projects would attract liquidity by offering a governance token as an incentive. Issues would arise as emissions slowed or the governance token fell in value, and liquidity would leave to seek greener pastures. In the vast majority of cases, this method was successful at attracting liquidity, but a failure at keeping it.   Tokemak attracts liquidity by offering single-sided vaults for users to deposit funds. These funds are then placed into LP positions, with safeguards in place to protect against impermanent loss. TOKE tokens are also paid to vault depositors as an incentive. TOKE can also be staked to control how the liquidity is deployed – called “liquidity directors”. This means that TOKE stakers are able to add liquidity for any token on any exchange, simply by holding TOKE – making it a powerful token to possess.   ## TOKEnomics  The total supply of TOKE is capped at 100M tokens. 30M of this supply is allocated specifically as rewards emissions for platform users. This 30M will be slowly emitted over 24 one-month cycles. The rest of the TOKE is split between investors, team, individual contributors, core participants, and market makers, and is subject to a 12-month vesting period after a 12-month cliff.   ## TOKE Stats  * Total supply: 100,000,000 TOKE * Circulating supply: 5,377,717 TOKE * Holders: 4,704  * Network: Ethereum  Tokemak is an innovative platform because it solves DeFi’s liquidity problem. Its token TOKE is a powerful governance asset that has the power to direct billions of dollars to wherever TOKE stakers choose, giving it massive inherent value. It is also a good product for the end user, who can experience sustainable yields with little-to-no impermanent loss risk. Right now depositors of TOKE can earn a massive [32.3% APY](https://midas.best/tokemak1) on their tokens!�13�0

2022-05-04 13:07:45�ui66s2�Stuff that may help when you are hunting altcoins/NFTs�At these cryptos/tokens the market cap isnt everything but the total liquidity in exchangers.    If there is a 1bln market cap coin doesn't mean its a safe buy, it can mean theorically that only 1 tx has been done and then the market cap is defined only by that, for this reason always focus on volume, liquidity and circulating supply.  And about nfts, think about it as a marketplace with low/russian roulette liquidity, buying NFTs is as risky as buying coins with low liquidity, meaning that you can easily buy, but not sell.   Wish you all luck out there in the DeFi world!�2�0

2022-05-04 12:42:56�ui5p5r�Ethereum price prediction: $5,800 by the end of 2022 — more than double its current level of $2,800. Stack, Stake and HODL ETH to the richest!!! GLTA!!!�Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, has seen its price swing wildly over the last year—hampered recently by a searing attack from Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey.  The ethereum price has lost around 43% since its peak of almost $5,000 per ether set late last year. Meanwhile, smart contract rivals BNB BNB +1.4%, solana, cardano, avalanche and polkadot have seen similar volatility.  Now, a panel of 36 industry experts has returned an ethereum price prediction of almost $5,800 by the end of 2022—more than double its current level of $2,800.  By Billy Bambrough, Forbes  &#x200B;  [To date, I've earned 3.9 ETH from staking!!! I'm projected to earn 3.2 more ETH by the end of this year, taking my total ETH earned to 7.1 ETH!!! Just keep on stacking via staking and HODL to the richest!!! GLTA!!!](https://preview.redd.it/31ikx6ilfgx81.jpg?width=1089&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24d4c4d9c4e1513e5c6708f6cdf69600d355a376)�0�0

2022-05-04 11:59:51�ui4x6k�Ethereum Price Prediction: $11,764 by 2025 and $23,372 by 2030�"Fintech and cryptocurrency specialists recruited for Finder’s panel believe ETH will peak at $6,872 on average in 2022. This is $2,000 more than its previous ATH of $4,900. Then it is predicted to drop to $5,783 by the end of the 2022.  Finder's experts are more gloomy on Ethereum's long-term potential which includes being used as a fuel to more projects than it does with some of its projects being Plastiks, Hydrominer, Cycled, Sandbox and so on, than they were in the preceding study in 2021. The panel's average projection for the end of the year was $6,500 in January of this year. This is a 12% increase above their previous forecast of $5,783.   Long-term, though, the average price prediction seemed promising. Ethereum will reach $11,764 by 2025 and $23,372 by 2030, according to the panel.  One of the most positive estimates for the end-of-year value of ETH came from Joseph Raczynski, a technologist and futurist at Thomson Reuters. He anticipates it reaching $8,000. He believes ""the Merge"" will contribute to the increase.   ""The Merge, an Ethereum update, is expected to take place this summer. This could have a huge impact on the token's value. This has been a long time coming for many people. It should be significantly more secure, energy-efficient, and deflationary. As a leading blockchain, if it isn't the trifecta of promise, I don't know what is.""   Raczynski isn't the only one who thinks this way. The deflationary mechanism of ETH, according to 35% of panelists, will have the greatest positive impact on price post-Merge.  Another popular belief was that ETH's low energy use would have a significant impact on price, as predicted by 29% of the panel. The higher transaction per second of ETH, according to 16 percent, will have a significant impact on price.   Asher Tan, the CEO of CoinJar, is optimistic about the future of ETH. He predicts that ETH will reach an all-time high of $8,500 in 2022, before rocketing to $35,000 by 2030.   Tan is one of the 31% of panelists that believe ETH will face a supply shortage. This is assuming that no additional Ether is created and circulated within the Merge and Shanghai Upgrade.   ""The Merge is one of crypto's biggest and most important events - and one that has the potential to unleash an overwhelming supply shock to the system,"" Tan said.  Finder's global cryptocurrency editor, Keegan Francis, is an expert on the subject. Ethereum, he adds, is in a precarious position. Ethereum will reach $5,000 in 2022, according to Francis. It will be valued at $10,000 by 2030.   ""I do not have long-term confidence in Ethereum unless the network updates its systems and delivers on its promises to scale."" Nonetheless, I believe that people will purchase the token based on its buzz, promise, and potential. However, I do not believe that ETH will continue to be the second most valuable asset in the world indefinitely.""  Boston Trading Co's CFO, Jeremy Britton, agrees. SOL, MATIC, and other cryptos, he predicts, will overtake ETH.   Carol Alexander, a finance professor at the University of Sussex, is optimistic about ETH's short-term prospects. However, she believes that by the end of 2030, ETH will be worth practically nothing.   ""ETH will become more important as De-Fi increases, but it will eventually go the way of all classic blockchain native coins as the new Internet of things technology develops – think IOTA tangle – towards the end of this decade.""   Overall, 61 percent of the panel believes now is the time to invest in ETH. It's time to hold, according to 32% of the panel. However, only 6% of the panel believes it is time to sell."�8�0
2022-05-04 11:44:50�ui4nl1�Did you know that over the next four years, the blockchain market is predicted to increase by 68.4 percent?�Over the next four years, the blockchain market is predicted to increase by 68.4 percent, with 86% of senior executives expecting blockchain will become a widely used technology.     That is something I frequently think about, especially when I learn about some great ideas that function on a blockchain or are made possible by the blockchain.     I was intrigued with how blockchain can secure our data, which has been a huge concern in recent years due to the prevalence of hacking.     I was fascinated by Modex, which creates scalable products and services that employ blockchain technology to change the way data and digital assets are stored, exchanged, and managed, might be one of the solutions to this dilemma for huge organizations.     However, blockchain technology continues to be a rapidly expanding area of growth for businesses in a variety of industries.     Would you agree that blockchain technology has the potential to far outperform cryptocurrencies in terms of the total effect and that the true potential of blockchain is only now being realized?     I am certain that the full potential of blockchain technology has yet to be realized.�11�0

2022-05-04 10:57:48�ui3wl9�What do you think is the next big thing? Just remember that ETH and BTC were unworthy at first, and look where they are today�Bitcoin is now seen as digital gold by many speculators, but it may also be used as a digital form of payment. While Bitcoin may be thought of as digital gold, Ethereum is constructing a worldwide computing platform that will support many other cryptocurrencies as well as a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps.     These two are among the finest investments anyone can make, but what about the next projects? Remember that ETH and BTC were unworthy at first, and look where they are today. So sometimes being patient really works out.      I was completely stunned (in a positive way) to learn that I may use Unicoins to invest in corporations with great expansion potential and that the earnings earned by such investments will be distributed to all Unicoin holders on a regular basis as dividends. This initiative appears to be promising (no more pump and dump difficulties or scams!).     We'd all like to discover a long-term investment and be delighted with the results, but the fact is that it's difficult to anticipate which of all these initiatives and currencies will be the best option. Especially now, when there are so many of these projects to choose from.     Experienced traders have been speculating on cryptocurrencies, but what if you're new to the industry and want to get in on the ground floor? So I'm asking for your opinions, and I wish you the best of success in your search for the next thing that will erupt as BTC did.�13�0

That doesn't seem reasonable, given that the top five collections alone accounted for more than $1 billion in primary and secondary sales in the same week they said the market was collapsing, don't you think?     I found out that in that article they stated that data from the NFT market analysis platform Nonfungible suggests the number of NFT sales has fallen by 92% since an all-time high in September 2021. Wallets active in the Ethereum NFT market were also said to have declined by 88% since a high in November 2021. I was like whaaaat???      Why would anyone say something like that?      What about the Moonbirds collection, what about all these upcoming collections and NFT projects? I followed all this news about them and I personally looking forward to some of them, Sk8coin for example, and maybe a few more.     Do you think that this attempt to create a panic is intentional or just someone's bad judgment and harmless misinformation?�9�0

Do you use some of this blockchain protection to keep your data, files, and privacy safe?     Every internet user should be able to select not just how their data and digital identity are utilized, but also which data they choose to keep private or public, and under what terms.     With the rise of technology has come the rise of projects and platforms that offer data protection. For example, having Zenotta's blockchain that re-imagines digital ownership and grounds it in a legal framework is cool, it was about time that we had platforms like this that provide us with saving our data (whether it's a photo, video, or anything else).     I think that's really great to know that we can now have all of that on a blockchain because, as data manipulation and theft become more common, these data sovereignty initiatives are becoming increasingly important for all of us who use the internet.     How do you cope with these issues, and does this concern you?      Unfortunately, I had a chance to experience some of these issues, and I don't think I'd want to go through them again, they were very unpleasant.�11�0

2022-05-04 07:52:04�ui1fie�"Do you believe Ethereum's scalability concerns have opened the way for ""ETH killers"" to seize the opportunity?"�"The problem is that even though how much Ethereum is powerful and powerful, all these coins that people call ""Ethereum killers"" are made to resolve all these Ethereum issues.      We're often dealing with the low scalability, network congestion, high gas fees, and environmental concerns which are some of the major issues. Some of these issues I control with Metis and before Metis other similar L2 solutions as I believe you all do as well.      Ofc that the technology behind the Ethereum blockchain is the primary reason for its meteoric rise, but as we are all aware there are these issues that must be solved. I really hope that transition PoS is going to be soon launched.     What do you think about ""Ethereum killers""?      They are very certainly attempting to dethrone Ethereum by fixing its blockchain flaws like as low scalability, expensive fees, low tps, and environmental concerns. They propose to do so by adopting the proof-of-scale consensus technique. Among the most well-known are Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, and Tezos.     Do you think they have any chance? And what do you think will happen with them as soon as the Ethereum merge happens?"�8�0

Bridges are there to facilitate sidechains and L2s and in order to mainstream ethereum we need to build vibrant bridges and active L2s. Would have been nice to see one of the biggest players help onboard more users who are priced out of mainnet AND maybe even priced out of bridging to L2 where they could thrive for much less in fees.   You can check your address to see if/what you qualify for: [https://app.hop.exchange/#/airdrop/preview](https://app.hop.exchange/#/airdrop/preview)  Luckily, if you are registered to earn donuts, the treasury is paying the bridging costs for you. Your donuts are on a cheap chain and from there you can go pretty much anywhere for pennies.  ## Edit: what is Hop?  Hop is a bridge to send tokens between ethereum networks: mainnet, polygon, gnosis, optimism, arbitrum.   > Hop is a scalable rollup-to-rollup general token bridge. It allows users to send tokens from one rollup or sidechain to another almost immediately without having to wait for the networks challenge period. > It works by involving market makers (referred to as Bonder) who front the liquidity at the destination chain in exchange for a small fee.  https://app.hop.exchange/#/send?token=USDC�1�0

2022-05-05 17:24:12�uj2g0w�Do you have that feeling that people are just interested in crypto and blockchain as an investment, ignoring its numerous use cases?�I've seen that as cryptocurrency prices are skyrocketing, most users are just interested in crypto as an investment, ignoring its numerous use cases. There are several obvious benefits for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, as well as how they may truly, drastically transform business processes.     Have you ever thought more thoroughly of blockchain and its benefits?     Just remember that so many companies started using blockchain these days. I've seen that Modex blockchain secured land registration, SMS frauds that telecommunication services are dealing with, health care records, and so on and on. Blockchain tech can be really helpful for so many things.     Since blockchain data is public information and cannot be altered without recording the change, blockchain provides unprecedented security and traceability for transactions.     Would you say that people will become more aware of all these benefits that blockchain brings and appreciate it more and not see blockchain and crypto only as a piggy bank?     I found [this link](https://www.connectbit.com/blockchain-applications/) where you can read about all the things blockchain could be used for, I am aware that most people don't know so many things about it but I truly believe that this is the tech of the future.�6�0

2022-05-05 16:00:08�uj0npd�What are your thoughts on using cryptocurrency to buy everyday items such as food, groceries, and clothing?�We've already heard that cryptocurrencies are being used for various types of payments, such as meals at restaurants, hotels, and even schools, and so on. As a result, it's not unexpected that a well-known fashion house like Gucci would begin taking cryptocurrencies at some of its U.S. locations.     What was the most surprising thing you learned you could buy using cryptocurrency?     It's interesting that Gucci stores will accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, among other digital currencies. Initially, I thought it would be Bitcoin or Ethereum.     Do you believe that this is how the future will look, with more and more people using cryptocurrency as a payment method?     I must state that crypto is clearly affecting the world, as seen by some things that amaze me. We may use it to pay for airline tickets, or we can invest Unicoins in companies with significant growth potential (Unicorn companies) and benefit from them.      You can pay for meals with cryptocurrency in three ways: sign up for the BitPay Card, purchase restaurant/delivery service gift cards with cryptocurrency, and pay directly with cryptocurrency to a limited number of restaurants and delivery services that accept cryptocurrency. Who knows what else we can all pay with crypto.      What do you believe is the most significant benefit of paying with cryptocurrency?�3�0

2022-05-05 15:28:23�uizyu1�What do you think what will 2022 look like for the GameFi sector?�With the rise of NFTs, blockchain gaming has finally gained traction, introducing the play to earn concept which now has so many fans who support these types of games, that's why for a short time we have plenty of these games.                    Remember the first games that made a boom on the gaming scene?  Axie Infinity, Splinterlands, and Alien Worlds becoming increasingly popular, and this market sector changed drastically from its early days. What was your first reaction to these types of games and the whole concept of playing to earn?        I was wondering since all these developed so fast, what will the future look like, what are your expectations? Is there something that you would like to change?       Would you say that these games took NFTs to another level? I think that NFTs are most used in the gaming sector, somewhere I read about it, which is quite reasonable since all these games are NFT-powered.       We have NFTs as gaming assets, which may be a gun or armor in a shooting game. I'm a fan of racing games, such as K4 rally, and NFTs might be, I don't know, a part of a vehicle or a car or something to modify your avatar in the game, weapon, magic, or whatever.       This year, I expect that there will be an increase in the number of users, that people will begin to adopt this game concept more openly, and that there will be even more options for users to earn coins while enjoying a unique blockchain-powered gaming experience.�9�0
2022-05-05 15:25:29�uizwod�What do you think blockchain tech can provide to the tourism industry?�We've seen that blockchain is becoming more and more popular in all types of businesses and industries. People become aware of all its benefits and how can it improve various types of projects and businesses. So, it's no wonder that tourism started using blockchain more and more.     Where did you find blockchain most useful, and for what type of industry?     I was aware at first that blockchain is pretty important for data and files protection, I only had experience with Zenotta blockchain for protecting files, more precisely for converting any type of file into smart data, which was so useful, and from that example, I've seen that thanks to blockchain tech you can provide some type of protection for your data or files.      So, it was only a matter of time before other industries would start using blockchain for that purpose.     The Tourism industry could greatly benefit from the use of Blockchain technology. These include lower prices, customer loyalty programs, and more accurate reviews.     I had no idea that we could now use travel platforms that provide greater transparency. They also allow tourists to submit comments on their trip. Locktrip and TravelChain are two Blockchain-based travel services, they're working on an internal system for controlling hotel bed inventories and other such things.     Do you think this will come to life and become something we will use regularly in the future?�4�0

What are the real-life uses of AR-NFTs?

Here are some of the questions we'd want to address:  \- With all of the different platforms available, which ones stand out to you for hosting VR meetings for 40-60 attendees?  \- Can you customize rooms/worlds to brand them for specific organizations and events?  \- Any other thoughts you have on VR Conferencing in general�3�0

2022-05-06 18:21:14�ujts04�Ethereum [ETH] has the fuel, but can it skyrocket by the end of 2022�"Finder organized a panel of financial professionals to produce an updated price estimate for Ethereum. Ethereum is expected to end the year at a high of roughly $5800, according to the panel. For many reasons, this is significant news for the Ethereum community.   For months, the Ethereum community has been in turmoil. With the impending Merge with a slew of other soft forks, this year was predicted to be their year of supremacy. Ethereum, on the other hand, has failed to live up to the hype. From its all-time high in November 2021 to about $2800, the Ethereum price has declined by more than 43%.  In the last two years, though, Ethereum has performed well in other sectors. The DeFi TVL in Ethereum has climbed 82 percent over the year, from $49.1 billion to $89.5 billion, according to a Bankless analysis. This metric represents the value of assets placed in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols including decentralized exchanges, money markets, and option vaults.   The growing interest in NFTs, which are the largest created on the Ethereum blockchain (and includes play to earn game based NFTs like Bored Ape Yacht and Sandbox and; green efficient projects like Plastiks and Cycled), has also benefitted Ethereum. The total volume of NFT sales on Ethereum is $25.6 billion, which is significantly higher than the next four combined.   However, the panel remains skeptical of Ethereum, citing the emergence of competing platforms during this moment of macro-turbulence. Finder's cryptocurrency editor, Keegan Francis, says,  ""Ethereum is now at a highly insecure point in its journey. Ethereum is currently losing DeFi market share to its competitors, despite the fact that it still has a big lead.... ""I don't believe Ethereum will ever be a second cryptocurrency.""   Joseph Raczynski, a panelist and a Thomson Reuters technologist, likewise warns that,   ""It (Ethereum) should be more safe, energy-efficient, and deflationary."" As a leading blockchain, if it isn't the trifecta of promise, I don't know what is."""�20�0

2022-05-06 17:22:48�ujsi5f�How do you feel about Meta and what do you think about how will it reflect on our privacy and data?�"Blockchain tech certainly continues to surprise more and more, we're having so many advantages thanks to blockchain.   But what often upsets me is that since the announcement of the Meta project, I've been led to believe that our data and everything about us will still be available to everyone and that they will know absolutely everything about us with the assistance of Meta.      Do you think that somehow blockchain could provide us security for that matter?     As we all know, our data has been available to others since the moment we began using the Internet and social networks, particularly through the usage of social networks, where we give away nearly all information about ourselves.     How do you feel about Meta and what do you think about how will it reflect on our privacy and data?     While machines can manipulate information using logic and math, they cannot maintain or define value, which is why we call this the ""data problem."" Zenotta is the only platform I used for this cause, cuz it can turn any type of data or digital material into Smart Data.     I must add as well that these things are cool cause if you're bad luck that your laptop tragically crashes, we're usually not worried about the hardware and applications, but about its data, whether they're images, songs, reports, movies, or anything.     Anyway, when we look at all of these solutions, systems, and applications, it's very astonishing how beneficial and amazing they are. We're truly experiencing all of these technological improvements and changes."�5�0

2022-05-06 12:17:12�ujm5u6�How To Know A Token Is Fundamentally Healthy�Although a token may be safe, how do you know it’s fundamentally healthy? There are several key features that make a token “fundamentally healthy”, but what does this even mean?    When a token is fundamentally healthy it means it is not just safe, but that it has the potential to be something successful. While some tokens may be technically safe, this does not mean that they will survive even their first hour of trading. Here are factors that come into play-    Transparency — If you’re in a tokens chat room and the developers are not being transparent about things such as the tokenomics, goals with the token, liquidity lock, etc, it’s one of the clearest red flags to take note of in a new token. The same can be said for the opposite, as transparent developers build trust with their community and investors, creating a more solid foundation for a token to build upon. Know you can trust a developer by watching their transactions live with CoinScan’s Dev Wallet Tracker    Holder Distribution — 99% of tokens have “Whales”, typically early investors that own large percentages of supply. Whales aren’t inherently a bad thing, however if 30% of a tokens supply is owned by 10 wallets while the rest of supply is owned by thousands, often just the 10 wallets will be able to make a token crash. Good holder distribution is not imperative, yet it is a green flag in the world of DeFi as no one person has too much affect on the price, ultimately leveling the playing field.    Good Liquidity — Optimal token liquidity is roughly 15%-20% of its market cap, this way buys and sells don’t have a massive price impact, therefore making the token less volatile while stillTokens with tiny liquidity (less than 10%) are extremely volatile as buys and sells have marginal price impact, essentially “Leverage” in terms of trading. While these tokens may appear to “Pump” harder, they can Dump equally as hard and are dangerous to throw large amounts of money into.    Good Community — More often than not, communities are the primary driving force behind most DeFi tokens! It’s always good to properly analyze and access the strength of a tokens community by joining their telegram, reading their twitter, or even participating in it yourself. If a community is not welcoming to new members, how will it grow?   Track ETH Tokens contract on https://www.coinscan.com/  Trade Defi the right way.�9�0

2022-05-06 11:49:36�ujlofz�TA: Ethereum Takes Hit, Why ETH Could Plunge Below $2,700�Ethereum started a major decline from the $2,970 zone against the US Dollar. ETH dived below $2,800 and might accelerate lower below the $2,700 support.  Ethereum started a major decline after it failed to surpass $2,970.  The price is now trading below $2,800 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.  There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).  The pair could decline further if there is a close below the $2,700 support zone.  Ethereum Price Dives  Ethereum struggled to settle above the $2,950 resistance. ETH topped near the $2,970 level and started a fresh decline. There was a sharp move below the $2,900 and $2,850 levels.  Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $2,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ether price declined below the $2,800 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, there was a spike below the $2,720 support level.  A low was formed near $2,678 and the price corrected a few points. There was a recovery wave above the $2,720 level. The price even climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,969 swing high to $2,678 low.  On the upside, an initial resistance is seen near the $2,760 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,820 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,969 swing high to $2,678 low. The main breakout zone is now near the $2,875 level.  Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com  A close above the $2,875 level could open the doors for a decent increase, In the stated case, ether price might rise towards the $3,000 resistance.  More Losses in ETH?  If ethereum fails to gain pace above the $2,760 resistance, it could continue to move down. An initial support on the downside is near the $2,720 zone.  The next major support is near the $2,680 level. If there is a downside break below $2,680 and the recent low, ether price might accelerate lower.

This new investment category has enjoyed almost as much success this year, with an estimated 250,000 people trading NFTs on OpenSea each month.     One business that has embraced NFTs is sports. And, as previously noted, these multiple benefits are best evident in sports, such as NFT match tickets, which allow committed fans to enjoy perks such as unique clips and moments of players, as well as other sorts of memorabilia. You may now purchase them using NFT TiX or any other site that offers tickets to various sorts of events. Isn't it wonderful how many alternatives these NFT tickets provide?     I've seen that as the popularity and purchasing of NFTs rises, so do the various sorts of perks that allow NFT holders to receive various extras, whether through NFT tickets or the NFT itself.     Who knows what more we'll be able to achieve with NFTs, but I like the direction it's going because there are so many benefits.�4�0

Does any of you know maybe?     Here is some statistic I find in this article: ""The Coinbase report also highlighted that Bitcoin is the king of crypto among U.K. consumers as it is the most commonly owned cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) is held by 52% of those surveyed with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Binance Coin (BNB) at 34% and 33%, respectively"".     Crypto is becoming so popular, I heard that people worldwide are so hooked with idea that they can invest in companies with raising potential, all that hype Unicoins caused a few months ago, remember?     But I always have that thought that even though our crypto community is large, there are even people who don't know anything about it or are not interested in this at all and they represent the majority of the population that thinks that way.      Does this number of crypto investors in the UK surprises you? Where do you think in Europe is a similar situation?     I think that without a doubt this number of people will increase more and more."�5�0
2022-05-06 06:57:30�ujhlns�Why have Bored Ape NFTs become so popular?�I was always curious why is BAYC gaining so much popularity, they look cool but what's the deal with them?  Not so long ago the Bored Ape NFT was listed for .08 ETH, that was more precisely in April of 2021, and now they’re trading for thousands of dollars each. My question is WHY?       Since the beginning of the NFT craze, I've seen so many fantastic NFT collections, so many beautiful artworks presented as NFTs, so many great communities and NFT projects like SK8coin, and so many great NFT games. I didn't pay as much attention to these popular ones, such as BAYC.        Pls, tell me what you think about it, and what do you think what's the main reason for this collection becoming so popular, like worldwide?       What occurred to me is that because so many celebrities were involved in this collection, we can see so many celebrities with apes as their profile pictures on social media. Another reason is that they might be used as metaverse characters.       But, in any case, they had the perfect timing, and they created such a boom when celebrities began purchasing monkeys.       What do you think will happen to BAYC next? With Ape currencies and their metaverse, they have been developing their ecosystem. The popularity of BAYC is expected to expand in the future years.�4�0
2022-05-06 06:40:40�ujhdep�Do you think it's possible that Ethereum gas fees might increase by 500% in the next two years?�What truly upset me was reading in an article that Ethereum gas fees might increase by 500% in the next two years. Do you consider that possible??     The Ethereum chain is still one of the most powerful in the cryptocurrency business. This was the first chain to use smart contracts, and it remains the largest open-source platform for decentralized apps.     The Ethereum chain, on the other hand, has struggled with limited scalability, decentralization, and a high gas charge.     The most obvious example is the recent Bored Ape NFT sale, which increased the Ethereum gas charge to $3,300. Even a $25 transaction on the Ethereum network when Bored Ape NFTs were being offered would cost $3,300 in gas fees.     I remember when I start using Ethereum I had no clue about all these issues, I was at first very disappointed lol until I start searching for these L2 solutions, now I use Metis which helped me a lot. What do you think is the best solution when it comes to these L2 platforms?     Ethereum has several major rivals as a result of the fundamental difficulties that some users can no longer tolerate.      How are you dealing with these issues? Have you considered quitting or have you found a solution?�4�0

2022-05-07 22:09:00�uknn7a�Since the beginning of NFTs, a lot has changed�I remember how I was amazed when I've heard the news about NFL  that is going to launch league-wide NFT tickets with Ticketmaster. That was like a whole new level of NFTs, soon after that, I was so into these types of tickets and trying to find all these events and marketplaces that are selling these tickets.     You may recall that the NBA was an early adopter of Top Shot, and basketball clubs had greater leeway. For example, Mark Cuban's Dallas Mavericks have started a ticketing NFT scheme similar to the NFL's, but it applies to all home games throughout the season rather than just a few.     In Europe, the Spanish soccer league La Liga has signed many agreements, including one for NFT collectibles with Sorare and moments with Dapper Labs. In the meanwhile, the NFT platform SportsIcon debuted documentary-style memorabilia. Real Madrid issued smart tickets as NFTs on the Flow blockchain, while Sorare sold a Cristiano Ronaldo collectible at Bonhams.     As you can see, a lot has changed since the inception of NFTs, but this is my favorite change of all because these tickets would give us so many benefits. We spent a lot of money on tickets before and didn't get anything, but with these tickets, we really have benefits, all these advantages come to my mind,  can't wait! I can only say now, here I come, NFT TiX lol�4�0

2022-05-07 21:51:51�uknaor�Blockchain, according to technologists, will someday replace usernames and passwords by providing us all with unique, encrypted digital identities�There's a lot of hype about how strong blockchain is in solving so many problems. I've heard that it's also one of the top data protection options, which piques my interest, and I've been wondering if personal privacy protection with blockchain may be the thing that propels the technology into the mainstream.     Modex did an excellent job of providing enterprises and large projects with security and data protection. I read some really nice articles about it on their website and became even more captivated with blockchain technology.     Blockchain, according to technologists, will someday replace usernames and passwords by providing us all with unique, encrypted digital identities that we can use to handle anything from internet information to our personal medical data.     Would you say it's the greatest way to safeguard our data, especially now since it's so easy to steal the passwords and usernames we use for every possible site, whether it's a social network or a shopping site, and we now have a lot of these logins and sign-ups?     It amuses me how blockchain will track and store all of our personal data, and because of its immutability, that data will remain safe and secure. In theory, it is how blockchain-based personal privacy protection may appear. Are you willing to accept it?     Because it is terrifying to understand that every Google search we conduct, every item we purchase online, and every time we use our prized customer ID at the grocery store is being logged because it is important to someone. I'm excited for these solutions to be implemented for ordinary users!�9�0
2022-05-07 21:37:41�ukn0qr�"Have you heard the belief that all of these currencies, particularly the popular ones, will rise in the near future, each with its own ""golden age""?"�"Have you heard about this theory that all of these currencies, especially the popular ones, will explode in the near future, that each of them will have its own ""golden age"" and that at some point, each of them will reach their peak, whether it lasts a long time or a short time, but it will happen? What are your opinions on the matter? Do you agree?     Of course, every investor wants to hear this, but does it seem rational to you? Every cryptocurrency has its own investors, therefore this is excellent news for all of us, right? You only have to be patient, whether you bought in Unicoin or Tether, can you envision everything working that way?     Seriously, I get nothing if the coin in which I invest bursts in 80 years LOL. Who knows, maybe they made something up to make people feel better, but how can you explain this theory? I'm completely perplexed! But I have to admit, that would be fantastic.     I know we're all thinking, ""Which one will bring the biggest potential return?"" but, in my opinion, your chances of a big payoff may be better with a smaller coin that hasn't already been pumped up by institutional investors the way bitcoin has (not financial/investing advice, just personal opinion)."�4�0
2022-05-07 21:10:56�ukmi51�Our data appears to be the most important resource for brand success, yet no one has even thanked us�"For some time people are dealing with issues such as companies abusing our personal data to drive their outreach and customer engagement efforts, as well as to assure a customized consumer experience, therefore increasing profits. Our data appears to be the most important resource for brand success, yet no one has even thanked us.     I was asking myself what are we going to do about it? We've all heard of the Big Four: Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. For these companies, a consumer's data is their most valuable commodity, which often leads to monetization abuses concealed deep inside complex revenue structures.     It's cool how the co-founder of Zenotta stated that they want to build a more ""decentralized, democratic, and fairer society in which individuals are empowered as sole owners of their personal data."" That is what we all require.     Of course, we must not exaggerate, because providing some data can allow us to participate in some convenience we would appreciate or be interested in, but only within fair limits.     I believe that in the future, this ""Data protect"" technology will emerge as the front-runner, with growing global services in a variety of domains. What are your thoughts?"�4�0

2022-05-07 11:46:12�ukblb2�What do you find most amazing when it comes to blockchain tech?�By the conclusion of the second half of 2022, there will be a stronger need for blockchain and crypto expertise. The increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, the increasing popularity of blockchain across a wide range of enterprises, and the potential for development in the blockchain industry all contribute to increased demand for blockchain and crypto capabilities.     It's incredible how rapidly the promise of blockchain for improving people's lives and building more resilient organizations is being fulfilled by huge corporations and governments, rather than just a small hyper-technical group of IT professionals.     Companies seek blockchain experts to assist them in implementing blockchain technology to meet their objectives. After doing an additional study into the blockchain industry, I discovered a few amazing firms about which I wanted to learn more.     What I've learned so far, Duet Protocol is one of these firms, they're a multi-chain asset platform that can be utilized to construct a blockchain asset. I'm excited to see how this project evolves in the future!     What do you find most amazing when it comes to blockchain tech?�4�0

2022-05-07 06:31:50�uk7al7�Ethereum Price Analysis (2700 range)�A prediction that ETH would trace back to local support has proven to be accurate, as ETH is now trading around the $2700 range. At the time of writing, ETH is just below this at $2680, where it has begun consolidating after yesterday’s crash.  ETH looks bearish on all time frames, with a slight bounce or consolidation likely on the 4H chart. Daily and weekly look very bearish, and a retrace to lower support levels is likely in the coming weeks. This is in line with BTC and other traditional markets, which have all been suffering as the world attempts to rein in spiraling inflation. These next few months will likely be painful, but will present good buying opportunities along the way.   Take a look at the [full eth analysis](https://t.me/midas_announcements/617) with charts.  **Support Zones:**   * $2.7k * $2.5k * $2.2k   **Resistance Zones**  * $2.9k  * $3.1k  * $3.4k�7�0

2022-05-08 19:45:22�ul9iwp�I believe many people are still unaware that cryptocurrency addiction may be as bad as a gambling addiction�Many have been fascinated by cryptocurrency from its inception, which I ascribe to the fact that it is unique, unlike any other type of investment we have used in the past. However, as time passes, this enthusiasm develops tremendously, and it appears that cryptocurrency is there on a daily basis, in our discussions, on television, in the news, and in our thoughts.     Can you say you were ever addicted to cryptocurrency?     Since I first started reading this post, I thought it was comical, like who the hell is addicted to cryptocurrency, but as I continued reading, I began to see myself in the instances they provided, and I was like oh crap, I'm addicted lol.     However, this could be serious, especially since crypto is becoming so common in our daily lives that we can now buy products and some stuff with it (even some schools in Dubai started accepting Bitcoin payments), we can buy houses, and even investing is different, we can invest in Unicorn companies with Unicoins, fashion houses started accepting crypto payments, some restaurants started accepting crypto payments, and so on.     It's not surprising that some individuals have gotten obsessed with it. I remember having a couple of nightmares involving cryptocurrency charts and thinking to myself, okay, I'm going mad lol.     What do you think? Could this cryptocurrency obsession grow into some serious addiction such as gambling? However, if we look at it from that angle, you may become addicted to anything if you don't have control over it, therefore maintaining balance in all that we do is the best strategy.�2�0

I've always been interested in weird objects, and as a kid, I started collecting playing cards, marbles, and other trinkets. So NFTs reminded me of it a little.     It's pretty nice how people get excited about them, everyone is talking about NFTs, which I really appreciate.     With so many NFTs being released every hour, how can you find out about these new collections? As an artist, how do you advertise your NFT collection?     I generally learn about new collections and projects via friends, as was the case with the forthcoming project SK8coin (since a handful of my friends are skaters and follow all these skating groups), and I learn a lot about collections on Reddit. Who knows how many collections we've overlooked.      How do you usually learn about new collections? Do you use social media?�7�0

2022-05-08 18:47:35�ul8bqc�How are you taking care of your personal data and files regarding that we're living in the digital era?�It wouldn't be surprising that probably all of us know someone who has been hacked and is suffering from some type of malware. I know a lot of people who have been unlucky victims of various sorts of malware, there are even organizations that have lost their data and have been threatened with sending a large sum of money in return for their personal data.       Due to the existing degree of cybercrime, it is expected that there will be far more as technology advances.       What worries you the most when it comes to these problems?        Cyber assaults, hacks, and frauds are all commonplace. We live in the digital age, and we should all be aware of how to safeguard ourselves and our data. To be honest, until I knew a lot about it, I didn't give it much thought.       And, of course, solutions to these difficulties are being developed at a frenetic pace.       It's incredible that any file type, whether static (like a signed contract in PDF or a photo in JPEG) or dynamic (like a data streaming service in MP3 or AVI format), may now be turned into a Smart Data file with its own, unique DNA. It's incredible to see how Zenotta handled issues like data privacy, digital property rights, and other concerns.       There are numerous options available nowadays, and we should make use of them for our own protection. It's fantastic that we now have a solution to secure our information without relying on the cloud or comparable services.�4�0

2022-05-08 18:33:28�ul80ss�Do you think that motorsports should use NFTs even more or you're not a huge fan of this whole idea?�I'm sure that we can all agree that NFTs are swiftly proving to be a tool for empowering organizations, as seen by several examples from various industries.     Corporations and people from a variety of industries are increasingly using NFTs and other relevant Web3 technology to gain access to alternate funding sources.      Motorsport fans have been wondering when the first major NFT-related project would be undertaken in one of the major motorsport leagues, and it appears that the time has finally come because I'm hearing more and more about new projects, whether it's a new NFT collection or an NFT game, such as K4 Rally, the first blockchain-based rally game ever.     Do you think that motorsports should use NFTs even more or you're not a huge fan of this whole idea?     I remember how I was surprised when I found out that in 2019, Formula 1 was one of the first racing leagues to use NFTs as part of a partnership.  They demonstrate that motorsports owners are forward-thinking individuals prepared to travel into unknown and unproven territories.     As far as I can tell, motorsports are taking a significant step and is confident in their choice to use NFTs in their company, which I support as a great fan of racing.�3�0

2022-05-08 18:09:59�ul7j7r�My first farming experience�I'm all about yield farming and trying several DeFi platforms. I'm wondering about how they differ, how they operate, which one is the best, most secure, easiest to use, and so on.     For the first time, I choose to use Netswap, the Metis network, which has a lot of farms and, from what I've seen, APRs of over 500 percent. There are a few steps to take, and they are pretty basic as you will see for yourself, so let's get started!     Since it runs on the Andromeda network, you must first add the Andromeda network to the Chain list, and then bridge over the token you choose at the start to the Metis network. You link your wallet and pay the charge, however, you should be aware that you must pay a fee in Metis tokens when you bridge back.     Now, how can you obtain a Metis token without switching and incurring exorbitant gas fees? You might utilize the Metis faucet, and then to complete the procedure, you should swap first, then go to the pool to add liquidity, and after you do so, you will earn pool tokens, and then you left to do to stake these tokens you have.       Quick note: in order to bridge out of the Metis Network, you must have Metis tokens on the Andromeda Network.   If you want to give it a shot, maybe this information may benefit you, as it did for me!     Write in the comments what you believe I should look into next. Maybe I might tell you about my farming experiences here, it could be interesting.�5�0

2022-05-08 13:36:03�ul1vhe�When it comes to zero knowledge proofs, how does it practically work in a private chain?�I get that ZK can allow you to share info without sharing the exact info, e.g.:  Question: Does Bob drink 10 cups of coffee a day  Answer: Yes, Bob drinks more than 10 cups of coffee a day but I am not going to tell you how many.  &#x200B;  But how do ZK proofs practically work in a private chain?  As I see it the Blockchain is like a paper. Each node is a copy of the piece of paper and transactions are validates across nodes. With ZK proofs, is all the transaction data (who is sending what to who, how much is in each wallet, who requested the info and who verified it), is that all private or is the meta data still exposed?   If the above is the case, why isn't ZK used in all cases on all blockchains?  Is all the validation or just the info sent to companies private?   Would not the 20x number of calculations needed for ZK for everything cause HUGE efficiency problems?�2�0

They have a refuel feature. It's not a faucet and its not free. It cost me a $1.99 to move 2.5 Dai to xDAI to have on the Gnosis chain which allows me to bridge my WETH converted to ETH from Gnosis to Ethereum main net.

2022-05-09 20:27:38�um0gli�Could you compare the rise of blockchain technology to the Internet’s breakthrough during the 1980s?�I enjoy that I've been able to experience so many fantastic technical advancements and developments in the last several years. We are shifting from the Web 2.0 age, in which social media dominates screens, to the Web 3.0 era, in which the Internet will be based more on blockchain technology.     Could you compare the rise of blockchain technology to the Internet’s breakthrough during the 1980s? I'm the one who will certainly agree with that, but there are some people who think it’s only a passing fad.     However, with over 19,000 altcoins in circulation, could it still only be a ‘passing fad’ if the market has become so vast and competitive?      Blockchain technology is pretty experimental right now and is used predominantly in niche communities, most notably in the cryptocurrency and NFT markets. Many companies are using Modex blockchain for data safety, we may now use blockchain for plenty of great things, not only that companies may implement blockchain tech into their operations, all of us who are regular computer users can.      A few days ago I learned how big a role blockchain could have in some everyday things we use at home. I'm certain that we would start using blockchain tech more and more. Do you like that idea, since blockchain proved to be very useful and helpful?     Smaller businesses, in contrast to governments and larger corporations, are still hesitant to adopt blockchain tech alongside crypto, but I think that all of us are becoming more aware of the fact that this represents our future. Do you agree?�5�0

2022-05-09 15:05:23�ultag5�Have you noticed that millennials invest in crypto like crazy?�I read an interesting article about how most millennial billionaires who have already invested a sizable amount of their fortune in cryptocurrency are considering investing more despite price changes.      Why do you think what is the main reason for millennials invest in crypto like crazy? Is it just a trend or this is something with what they grow up with so it's something kinda normal to them?     Interestingly, on the other hand, cryptocurrency holdings are much less popular among older generations.     I think that we now have so many great solutions for investment, older people are still old school when it comes to investing, but younger people are constantly surrounded by crypto news, projects, etc. They're more familiar with it.      A great example is Unicoins which you can invest in potential Unicorn companies, so many people are interested in the project but I heard that a lot of young people are talking about this project.     What would you say, will older generations soon start investing in crypto or they'll stick to noncrypto investment?�10�0

2022-05-09 12:25:45�ulq28a�Do you have that feeling that little by little, blockchain technology is beginning to appear around the house?�Blockchain technology is well-known among cryptocurrency users and national banks, and it is quickly gaining popularity among gamers. Applications in industry, notably supply chain management, are also emerging.        I would never guess that blockchain technology may improve life at home in unexpected ways, such as providing high-quality food, sustainably sourced seafood, or combating pharmaceutical counterfeiting. However, the house may be the ultimate frontier for blockchain.        What do you think about implementing blockchain in our everyday lives?       I always considered blockchain for gaming and data protection in which for that case I use Zenotta, for files converting to smart data, but it never occurred to me that there are plenty of advantages that are available for things we do on a daily basis.       Did you know that we can even use blockchain tech in cases such as home heating and cooling, which is typically the largest household energy need?        Do you use some of these blockchain solutions for your home? Do you consider all of these as something that we would all use in our homes?�5�0

2022-05-09 12:15:02�ulpv7d�Does it look like the move-to-earn games are the next big thing in the gaming sector?�Have you heard that there have been a lot of talks recently regarding move-to-earn games and that some believe they are the next great thing in the gaming industry? What are your thoughts on this sort of game?     I must admit that it took some time for me to get used to p2e games and all of the possibilities of NFTs in these games. I tried so many of these games looking for the perfect one until I recently discovered K4 Rally (I've always been a racing game fan), so I can't imagine that now I start playing some other types of games as well, it seems too early for that lol.     I'm kidding ofc, since what I found out was that these are not some regular games, it's all about health, getting yourself into healthier habits, and so on. The industry’s new buzzword follows the p2e model but centers on health and fitness, where users are rewarded for their physical activity.      Do you think this is too much, do we need this or do you think it's an awesome idea and could be useful? I don't know what to think until I see how they did develop these apps or games, whatever they call them.     As I figure it out when users play the game, the app tracks their movement through the GPS on their mobile phones and rewards them with in-app tokens, as we have now on our phones that steps counting or something like that, so, maybe it could be fun.      Did anyone try this M2E model?�2�0

2022-05-09 09:03:13�ulmzmj�What would you single out as the best thing about holding Ethereum?�According to CoinMarketCap, there are currently over 19320 cryptocurrencies in the world. This makes it difficult for investors to determine which ones will be lucrative in the long run. But my favorite is Ethereum, which is not without reason the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market valuation.     What would you single out as the biggest advantage of Ethereum?     As we all know there are plenty of benefits, for example, NFTs since Ethereum is the major blockchain where most of the top known nonfungible tokens are launched.      It's no wonder that people are thrilled about owning Ethereum because the market prediction for NFTs is predicted to reach over $130 billion in sales by 2030, with a 33 percent annual growth rate. This indicates that Ethereum will be in high demand since it is essential to pay fees when producing or purchasing tokens on decentralized platforms such as OpenSea.     Even if we have to use Metis or other L2 solutions to decrease gas prices, which can be enormous, as the gas fees climb, the price of Ethereum will increase as well since token holders on the Ethereum blockchain require Ethereum to transact on the network.     What are your thoughts on the news that Ethereum gas fees are predicted to increase by 500% in the next two years? If the price of Ethereum rises proportionally, we should anticipate it to trade for at least $15,000 by the end of 2024.�3�0

2022-05-10 20:27:04�umrwko�Ethereum is suffering, giving us a theme for discussion.�"The price of Ethereum has plummeted from the $2,700 level to below $2,400. As a strong believer in ETH, I had to go a bit further with the analysis.  ""Miner revenue"" is a significant indicator that just touched a nine-month low. Miners' earnings on the Ethereum network have lately dropped to $1,476,333.1. In March 2021, the previous low was recorded. An increase in selling pressure on the cryptocurrency is caused by a decrease in miner earnings.  To meet their operational expenses, miners sell the asset, resulting to an increase in exchange reserves and selling pressure on the cryptocurrency.  According to statistics from the crypto intelligence portal Glassnode, Ethereum is experiencing more instability. Due to a delay in the ""Merge,"" the move from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, negative market sentiment has dominated for Ethereum. To gain community support, the Ethereum Foundation published a roadmap for the event.  The number of addresses that have been lost has risen to 24.5 million, the highest level since May 2020.  The primary elements impacting Ethereum's recovery, according to supporters, are a mix of increased selling pressure from miners, a large number of addresses in loss, and unfavorable mood among investors.  The changes in these factors can be really unpredictable and that's why you should decide if it's time to stay in ETH or go further with your investments. For now, I keep believing in ETH, but still have a smaller part of my portfolio diversified to some projects that I believe will go high this year. It's mainly ROSE, Cardano, and High Sloth Society, with a small percentage of my portfolio in other projects. What are your tactics for this inevitable bearish market that's going to last for some time as we can all see?"�2�0

This would not involve liquidity providing on mainnet and gnosis, because I think those are still low, so just the  issuance from 4m/month to 2m/month.   As I see, the majority of the sub is just dumping the farmed donuts instantly, we can see this on the price, so I think a lot of us would vote ""YES"" to this proposal who are hoarding donuts for governance/tipping or just because its a nice meme token :)   We could maybe incentivize a lot more people to COLLECT and USE donuts, not just FARM it for a few dollars every month with this poll.    Thanks for 420Weedscoopes!(I copied a few things from his proposal :) )    If we got the greenlight for the poll I will need some help with the snapshot.     Poll:  Should we halve the monthly issuance from 4m to 2m donuts?  1. \[Yes\] I support the ""HALVE"".    2. \[No\] Issuance should stay at \~4m/month.    3. \[Abstain\] I am not into donuts.    “This proposal will be stickied for a minimum of 2 days and requires at least 2 mods to sign-off on the formatting before proceeding to a snapshot vote per the governance rules and guidelines [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance)           Link to the poll: https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/uo1tbz/governance_polldonut_halving/"�6�0

2022-05-10 14:51:55�umkidj�Diversifying your portfolio also applies when using stablecoins�If the last days taught us anything its this.  Dverisfying your assets also applies to stablecoins.  Diversify between all stablecoins and also between platforms. As we saw a stablecoin can depeg and lose a lot of its value leading to big loses in an asset you thought was safe.  At the same time if the last mo ths have shown us anything is that everything and anything is hackable  Thus simple logic says: Dont use  one stablecoin on one platform Dont use one stablecoin on several platforms Dont use several stablecoins on one platform.  Have several stablecoins on several different platforms. Easy, but a little bit more work.   You can easily find a list of platforms i personally use 6 different platforms, some more knowm than others and some more risky. As for stablecoins i use USDC DAI USDT UST and PAX and have all of them earning an average of 10% APY.   Yes I also have UST but i knew the risk was higher so my bag is smaller and still chilling on Anchor, calculated risk for 20%, higher yield higher risk.   Also id like to add thag most platforms offer a sign up bonus when using a referal, sometimes up  50$ for amounts below 1k $.  Thats money earned out of thin air which you can then add to your assets.   Play smart and play safe, diversify and keep a percentage of your portfolio in stablecoins for these wild markets we are witnessing�2�0

It sounds like something from the Sci-Fi movies, right?     But believe it or not thanks to the blockchain tech this is possible but it only sounds scary, here's what I've found out about it.      These days I'm learning a lot of new things about blockchain, whether it's Modex blockchain which many companies use for complex operations or blockchain that resolve some regular house chores, or this one that has an impact on our mind.      In which sphere or industry do you consider a blockchain a MUST HAVE?      This new social platform is called Tau and there your profile will be your Worldview. The exact definition of Tau would be ""Tau is the first-ever decentralized blockchain social network able to take the thoughts, advice, and knowledge of its users and update its own code in real-time to give all users control over what the software does for them and how it evolves at any scale"".     Do you think these are the platforms of the future?     This one appeals to me since it allows it to grasp the perspectives of its users, which may be beneficial. Imagine if thousands of scientists were given the necessary tools and could efficiently discuss a potential cure for cancer and find the greatest possible answer in record time.     Do you believe these platforms are unnecessary for society or do you believe they will play an essential part in future growth in every imaginable sphere?"�1�0

2022-05-10 10:47:02�umfulm�Many people are talking about how Ethereum gas fees are predicted to increase by 500% in the next two years, does that mean that the price will rise as well?�Since many people are talking about how Ethereum gas fees are predicted to increase by 500% in the next two years, does that mean that the price will rise as well?      I'm not sure that I figure this out completely, what depends on the increase in Ethereum gas fees, how is it all that connected?     In that case, would all these L2 solutions that people use be helpful? I got a recommendation for Metis, didn't use any of these L2 platforms for reducing gas fees so far.     Since all cryptocurrencies are dropping these days, how long do you think this trend will continue? Is it smart to invest now or to wait a little bit longer?     I have like tons of questions, sorry! Have a great day guys!�1�0

2022-05-10 10:20:09�umfg6l�Would you say that NFTs are making through tickets a direct relationship between artists and fans?�Major ticketing services, in particular, are leveraging blockchain technology as a way to provide digital tickets, special offers, updates, and more to event attendees. I love how NFTs are making through tickets a direct relationship between artists and fans.      We can use a music concert as an example. However, by the time you find out about a concert, tickets are already sold out, and the scalped tickets are now being offered on the secondary market, sometimes known as the black market.     So, how does that go? Simple, ticket scalpers buy a large number of sports and entertainment event tickets with the express intent of reselling them for a substantial profit over the original purchase price.     It would be smart to look out for NFT ticketing platforms such as NFT TiX for example because this would be certainly the future of the ticketing system. It eliminates the need for a physical ticket and connects users directly to the NFT ticketing marketplace.     What do you think? I believe this is more than enough motivation to begin utilizing NFT tickets for all potential events.�4�0

There is these thing called the 10k club for all those that bought and own digit ENS domains. Think area codes and zip codes. 123, 1234, etc. People went bonkers. That led to people buying 3 letter words. LOL, SMH, IBM, ICO, FWB. You name it. Now we are onto 4 digits and 4 letters and beyond. People are scraping anything they can find. Cities, artist, sports teams, counties, brands, etc. etc. etc.   Obviously all this depends how successful and what is developed on Ethereum in the next years but the bet is on and some are going heavy and when the time comes they wont be releasing these ENS domains for cheap. If you aren't familiar with ENS for example you can register voteforpedro.eth or vote4pedro.eth. Well you can buy it rom whoever owns t by now. They are both taken. These were just examples.

2022-05-11 19:04:45�unhaqd�So this is what is currently crashing the market:�Blackrock and Citadel borrowed 100K BTC from Gemini (it appears in their loan book). They swapped 25K of that BTC into UST; this was all done quietly in anticipation of the attack.     When the time was right, they called up Do Kwon at Terra Foundation and said they wanted to sell a lot of BTC for UST. As it was a large trade they told him they didn't want to move the market and asked if he would like to buy their large block of BTC at a discount for UST. Do Kwan took the bait. He gave them a huge chunk of UST, thus lowering the UST liquidity significantly. At that point, Blackrock/Citadel dumped all of the BTC and UST causing massive slippage and triggering a cascade of forced selling in both assets. The real problem was Blackrock/Citadel knew that Anchor, which holds a lot of LUNA, was a Ponzi scheme (they offer 20% staking APY for Christsake) and this crash would trigger more withdrawals than Anchor can repay. These forced withdrawals and selling would trigger a massive selloff in Luna, thus further breaking the $1 peg and wrecking the market further.    Blackrock and Citadel can now buy the BTC back cheaply to repay the loan and pocket the difference. Meanwhile, billions of longs and Bitcoin VaR were wiped out.  How did you make out?   Are you buying this manufactured dip?  This was pure market manipulation.�61�0

2022-05-11 14:16:20�unav18�ETH/USD Forecast: Ethereum Sheds 15% to Kick Off Week�"To begin the Monday session, Ethereum has dropped 15%, or $400. It will be fascinating to watch if buyers can pick up the market at the $2300 level, as they have done in the past. The fact that we are closing at the absolute bottom of this candlestick indicates that negative pressure is more likely than not to persist. The market will most likely attempt to reach $2000 at that point.  The $2000 level is a significant round number that will attract a lot of attention and generate a lot of headline concerns. If the $2000 mark is breached, it will open the door to significantly lower pricing, and I believe we will finally experience what is known as ""crypto winter."" In that case, the market is expected to accelerate significantly, resulting in a large unwinding of long holdings.  It's interesting to see how much we've given up during the day, and the fact that we've formed such a large candlestick suggests that plenty of people will be leaving ship. You should be aware that many institutions have invested in Ethereum which has the largest ecosystem over the likes of Quint and Solana; and are experiencing significant losses not only in this market but also in other markets. When there are losses across the board, these larger funds are often forced to liquidate practically anything they can get their hands on. It's all about trying to discover shards of liquidity at that time.  It's also worth noting that Bitcoin was completely destroyed over the day, and it appears that we're on the verge of another ""crypto winter."" If you're looking for a long-term investment, you should be able to acquire crypto at a far lower price, not just Ethereum. We're probably in a ""do or die"" situation at this point, so pay close attention. Rallies at this point will almost certainly give considerable resistance that we can sell into, but I'm not interested in trying to become long Ethereum right now."�14�0

2022-05-11 13:05:37�un9epy�[Poll Proposal] Pay to Post for Donut Registered Users�This proposal addresses the increased amount of post spamming on r/Ethtrader by proposing a fee to post for users **who are registered to receive Donut distributions**. This fee would disincentivize spammers by causing them to sacrifice a large portion of any rewards they earn without putting undue burden on normal and productive sub members.    ## Motivation & Process - Reduce the proliferation of spam posts for the purposes of donut farming by disincentivizing mass posting of low-quality and low-effort content. As the profitability of spamming low-upvoted posts goes down, the incentive to farm will be reduced. - Charging a fee for posts will essentially create a new *burn mechanism* in which fewer donuts will be issued during each distribution period.  - As spam posting is reduced, there will be more opportunity to engage with the quality content that is currently buried under endless memes, tweets, and links.  - **We do NOT want this to** be a burden on new users, users not registered to receive donuts, or users who post productive and quality content. To that end, this will **in no way impact the process of posting.** All users who meet the karma and age requirement will continue to able to post without any interruption. At the end of each distribution period, the total fee for posting will be deducted from any earnings received, thus only affecting users who are actively engaged in earning donuts. In the event that a user accrues more fees than they earn, they will receive 0 Donuts for that distribution.  - **How we set the fee:** A *reasonable fee* should allow every registered user the ability to post and earn on quality content, but should be high enough to be a burden to farmers who spam low-effort posts that receive small amounts of upvotes. With that criteria we are proposing to start with a fee of **250 donuts per post**.  	- On average, r/Ethtrader has about 6,300 posts during each distribution period. While the total number of posts by unregistered users is unknown, it can be assumed that the indicated fee will reduce monthly distributions by 30-40%.  	- On average, registered users earn about 3,500 donuts per distribution. As the number of spam posts is reduced, there will be less fee pulled out of each distribution and each productive user will end up earning more per post.  	- **The fee should be increased and/or decreased in the future if it is found too restrictive or ineffective.**    ## Specification - Each post will incur a fee of **250 Donuts** - At the end of each distribution, the total number of posts made by each registered user will be tallied and the total fee will be deducted from any earnings received.  - In order to ensure that spammers don't cheat by deleting old posts, the Automod will create a record of each post/poster for the purpose of tallying fees.  - Deducted donuts will be removed from the distribution and will **NOT** be issued. - After fee is taken out of the distribution, the amount mods earn will be recalculated based on the reduced distribution amount.  - This fee will apply to all posts, regardless of flair type.  - This fee will **NOT** apply to r/Ethtrader members who are **NOT** registered to receive Donut distributions. - The fee can be adjusted in the future through a governance poll.   ## Poll Options The poll options would be:  **[Yes]** - Users earning donuts should pay a reasonable fee to post content.  **[No]** - Keep posting free for all users.      ---  _This governance poll proposal will remain up for a minimum of 2 days per the [governance guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance). This proposal requires sign off from 2 moderators to proceed to a full governance poll._�1�0

And we have these cool urban art NFT museums in Berlin, as well as a great NFT collection that represents urban art, such as Skate Punks, and that great community Sk8coin, which is also a marketplace that supports skaters and artists, and what is very interesting is that it offers many real-world benefits.     I'm curious whether we've all started paying more attention to art after NFTs were invented and we were introduced to amazing pieces of art through them. Because photography is my main passion and I have always been fascinated by art, this digital art through NFTS has become quite intriguing to me, especially when it comes to street art.     But what were the advantages and disadvantages of exposing your work through NFT?   If there are any NFT artists among you, I'd love to hear your thoughts on pretty much anything.�3�0

2022-05-11 11:49:37�un8053�How do you see the future of blockchain technology? What changes will it involve?�While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were extremely popular in the larger financial and economic sectors in late 2017 and early 2018, they have since become more of a niche market for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Although blockchain is most known for its role in aiding the emergence of digital currencies in recent years, it also has several non-cryptocurrency applications.     While blockchain technology has supplied us with so many benefits, whether they are real-world or crypto-related, we have witnessed many amazing things. I'm still blown away by the idea that Zenotta's blockchain can convert jpg, pdf, and other files from our computers into smart data.     Still, blockchain technology remains a fast-developing area of development for organizations across a wide range of sectors. Blockchain technology is going to be regarded as the most significant invention to come from the bitcoin explosion.     That is only a small portion of what blockchain can provide us, I can't wait to see future creations! Blockchain technology has the potential to benefit individuals, businesses, and society as a whole.     How do you see the future of blockchain technology? What changes will it involve?�6�0

2022-05-11 11:20:37�un7jfh�Your top blockchain games?�Hello, guys,  I've been thinking about the recent major shift when it comes to blockchain gaming. I was wondering how you would feel if these classic games we used to play disappeared and they've replaced by NFT-powered games?     I know folks who just play p2e games today, but I'm one of the ones that still play both and will continue to do so forever, I can't imagine ever stopping playing traditional games. Which group do you belong to?     Some people despise this new form of gaming and refuse to accept it. It's fine to disagree, but I don't think these NFT games aren't worth playing, especially if you discover the right ones.     There are many games that match the highest requirements, and a big part of these games outperform traditional games. I frequently advise anyone who is interested in racing games to start with the K4 Rally, and then we can talk about quality and playability since that game is the greatest.     What are your picks for the top blockchain games?     As a massive fan of video games from a young age, I couldn't imagine that I stop playing them, that's not gonna happen.      I've always been interested in game advances and developments, thus I wholeheartedly endorse this approach. Because technology must progress, this is what we have, and I believe it's fantastic, but we shouldn't forget about conventional games.�3�0

2022-05-11 11:03:56�un7aav�What are the advantages and disadvantages of the metaverse, in your opinion?�Even if we have to wait for about 10-15 years for this project to fully develop, this topic is becoming more and more popular every day. Some can't wait for the entire project to develop and become available to everyone, while others are afraid of the unknown, especially after seeing all of the metaverse's potential.     What are the advantages and disadvantages of the metaverse, in your opinion?     We should not forget all of these great aspects of this, and I am looking forward to seeing what the metaverse has in store for us. I feel it is past time to redirect technology toward something beneficial, something that will help people and improve their skills and knowledge.     There are also several projects interested in developing and improving the metaverse. For all of us who are interested in Ethereum, Metis is developing an L2 to reduce gas costs, while Ethereum's trust may be a suitable entry point for the metaverse's relationship with blockchain. For example, advances in sharding and interoperability allow different environments, assets, and identities to be held on distinct blockchain networks while yet allowing for seamless interaction.     What do you hope for from the metaverse, and do you feel it will have more positive or bad aspects?�3�0

To be honest, I didn't.     ApeCoin has surpassed Tether and Loopring as the third most bought cryptocurrency among the top-100 Ethereum wallet addresses, behind Ethereum and USDC. Did anyone expect that?     These days I've been hearing a lot about new cryptocurrencies, first was Unicoin which I truly believe would make great expectations very soon, and now is this ApeCoin.     What do you think about ApeCoin, is this just a current trend or this is going to be huge as time passes?   Do you think this coin seemed promising to holders just because of BAYC's popularity?�0�0

2022-05-12 19:56:37�uo9l24�Why ETH and the general crypto market is suffering�(Before I say anything I’m not any licensed professional all I am is just a guy who loves cryptocurrency)  As you definitely know by now crypto specifically has taken a beating. And my first thought is, “Hmm I wonder how the stock market and the general market is doing.” Barely anything has happened in that field compared to the beating crypto has gotten. Why? Well I feel like this is straightforward, most people in the crypto field are day traders and are testing this new thing. When they here of this big recession coming they sell all of their short term and less meaningful investments. I know there are a large number of people who think crypto is the future, I’m one of them. But with the upcoming food shortage and oil shortage there is an indefinite upcoming bearish future. That’s also not to mention COVID-19 still roaming around. There will probably be a big crypto sell off until someone offers the world more oil and wheat. It’s a really complex and wacky economic situation that is super hard to predict but I can see a really bearish future ahead.�0�0

2022-05-12 19:29:38�uo900t�Do you know that it's estimated that by 2026, the business value added by blockchain will grow to just over $360 billion, then by 2030 grow to more than $3.1 trillion?�That implies blockchain is the technology of the future, right? Do you think that's possible?       However, that information does not surprise me given that I recently discovered that Google, Goldman Sachs, Visa, and Deloitte are investing in blockchain initiatives. And companies developing blockchain-based services, such as Spotify, to handle copyrights. I was aware that IBM uses blockchain; they are developing a tracking tool for shipping businesses and retail chains.       Only 10% of firms will have undergone any fundamental shift utilizing blockchain by 2022. I have heard that Modex (a Microsoft Silver Partner) is developing suitable software apps to service certain sectors and use-cases on top of our blockchain database architecture.       All of these companies appear to grasp the promise of blockchain technology. What do you believe is the most crucial benefit that blockchain can offer its users?       Would you agree that hearing about all of these huge firms and tech titans recognizing the benefits of blockchain is good for blockchain because consumers will have greater trust in this invention now that all of these big names have started utilizing or investing in it?�1�0

2022-05-12 14:50:59�uo2unf�Funny how all these “ETH killers” arent holding up nearly as much as ETH�When the market is bullish and everything is green, they’re “ETH killers” but when the market dumps the narrative changes and they’re “only alts after all, alts dump the hardest”.  Where’s that energy now? Where are they gone? Don’t get me wrong, Ethereum isn’t in a good place right now. In fact, it’s in one of its worst stages its been in a long while. But when you compare it to other chains like Solana or Cardano, it holding up WAY better.  The fact is, the main selling point of these “ETH killers” is that they’re cheaper and faster but the reality is that a lot of them are unreliable like Solana or have a very poor ecosystems like Cardano  Meanwhile Ethereum has a bunch of dedicated scaling solutions that compensate for gas fees and low TPS. Polygon alone has put up more than 6 multipurpose scaling solutions since 2021 dedicated to scale Ethereum and it already has a much better and diverse ecosystem than both Solana and Cardano combined with more than 18,000 dApps on the chain. If anything both Ethereum and Polygon independently have more daily active users than all other supposed “ETH killers”  Although I’m really frustrated with what’s going on in the market and wouldn’t want to see anyone lose money, I’m at least glad that a lot of projects and their supporters have been humbled the past couple of days.�4�0

2022-05-12 14:12:45�uo20zj�What are your thoughts on receiving your salary in cryptocurrency?�I heard that these types of payments are becoming a trend and so many people started to get their paycheck in crypto, but why would someone prefer crypto over more widely accepted fiat currency? What do you think?     I'm aware that cryptocurrency is valuable. I found one example where one guy was paid like  $13 million in bitcoin in 2010, and that would be worth billions of dollars today. Well, that's pretty cool.     These days we have so many opportunities with crypto, there are more and more places where we can pay something in crypto, airplane tickets, restaurants, hotels, and fashion brands, and all of them started to accept ETH, BTC, and other cryptocurrencies as a way of payment. There are as well Unicoins if you're interested in investing in some growing companies, so we have plenty of opportunities to use a huge number of cryptocurrencies. But...     But this is why I believe it is still too early to be paid in cryptocurrency because if a person wishes to spend all of their money on domestic items such as rent, utilities, food, and entertainment, receiving payment in cryptocurrency is not highly useful because the majority of the merchants they would have to pay will not accept cryptocurrency. Customers would instead have to trade their tokens for fiat currency, paying exchange service fees and maybe even tax fees depending on where they live.     One thing I don't get is when we have a situation like today when cryptocurrencies are dropping, does it indicate that salary, if paid in crypto, would also rise or fall?     Would you be willing to get paid in crypto?�2�0

2022-05-12 14:02:46�uo1tbz�[Governance Poll]Donut halving.�"   The last halving was about 2 years ago in May  This poll would be about donut issuance halving.  This would not involve liquidity providing on mainnet and gnosis, because I think those are still low, so just the issuance from 4m/month to 2m/month.  As I see, the majority of the sub is just dumping the farmed donuts instantly, we can see this on the price, so I think a lot of us would vote ""YES"" to this proposal who are hoarding donuts for governance/tipping or just because its a nice meme token :)  We could maybe incentivize a lot more people to COLLECT and USE donuts, not just FARM it for a few dollars every month with this poll.   Poll:  Should we halve the monthly issuance from 4m to 2m donuts?  1. \[Yes\] I support the ""HALVE"". 2. \[No\] Issuance should stay at \~4m/month. 3. \[Abstain\] I am not into donuts.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  ​ Link to the poll proposal:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/umntlg/poll\_proposaldonut\_halving/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/umntlg/poll_proposaldonut_halving/)  ​  Link to the poll:  [https://snapshot.org/#/ethtraderdao.eth/proposal/0x5892e961f711aa41bc21b4f604e3ef2f1a50580a748a261767a994c4d6edb0fe](https://snapshot.org/#/ethtraderdao.eth/proposal/0x5892e961f711aa41bc21b4f604e3ef2f1a50580a748a261767a994c4d6edb0fe)"�10�0

2022-05-12 13:22:37�uo0zau�Sometimes I get that feeling that metaverse is trying to lock people up in houses�What's your opinion on metaverse? Are you supportive of this whole idea or not? I must say that I'm not so sure what to think, many people singled out so many bad sides, and the project didn't even develop, I suppose that I'll give it a chance, but tbh I'm not so crazy about it, but I would appreciate hearing the ones who love all this concept and to hear the reasons for that.     I'm aware that it could potentially change how we interact with each other. The creation of this new space will require overcoming numerous technical and social challenges. However, overcoming them will revolutionize how we experience social media and communicate with each other in general.     But sometimes that led me to think that maybe we're going to become antisocial, or at the very least less sociable than we are now.     It's all about connecting the real and virtual worlds for the first time, but tell me honestly why do you think that we need that, for what?     I even refused to play these metaverse games, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of blockchain games, my fav one is K4 Rally, I play a few of these games, but I was never interested in the metaverse, cause until now I don't see the right reason why would I be.     What do you think, why we should be attracted to the metaverse project? Why do I need virtual clothes when I can buy the real ones, or why would I attend a metaverse concert when I can attend in person? Sometimes I get that feeling that metaverse is trying to lock people up in houses.�2�0

2022-05-12 12:09:02�unzksq�Does the Layer-2 transaction fee need to be below $0.05 to be acceptable?�This issue was discussed in one of the articles I’ve read today, what would be your answer?     Regardless of how much we like and admire Ethereum, we must be honest about the unpleasant scalability concerns and high gas prices that have made it impossible for the network to expand. I'm supposing that every one of you is using some sort of L2 solution, Metis, or something like that. We're fortunate in that we can select from a variety of these solutions, all of which are quite good and, more importantly, useful.     We all have seen that Layer-2 transactions are so much easier and less expansive, they become something that we can’t work without. For example, Polygon, and Polkadot are common Ethereum Layer-2 solutions which are great as well. Which one are you using?     One of the major issues of high prices of gas fees is Ethereum’s popularity, that’s one of the major reasons. That’s why I can’t understand people who are always complaining about this issue, okay, it is annoying but you should know that you’re holding one of the greatest cryptocurrencies ever…     Some of you may be interested in knowing that, according to analysts, the value of Ethereum will climb 400% by 2022. As you are aware, Ethereum is used by a wide range of DApps, including games, supply chain solutions, and DeFi platforms. So, as I previously stated, the price of gas costs climbs as Ethereum's popularity grows. Miners require more computer power to stay up as more people use the blockchain network, thus transactions with a greater gas cost limit are prioritized.     What is your solution for avoiding expensive gas fees? I know that some people are doing transactions at a non-peak times, such as on weekends.�4�0

2022-05-12 06:54:58�unv1x7�Is it just me, or do you believe the Metaverse isn't questioned enough?� I recently looked at a [discussion about blockchain gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kirin_Official/comments/u6z80i/what_blockchain_gaming_could_look_like_in_the/) and I kind of have mixed feelings about the idea that one day, humans will be entirely engaged in a virtual world with little to no social connection in the actual world since the day I first heard about Facebook's new 'Metaverse.'  For some backstory, I used to spend a lot of time playing online sim type of games like Second Life, Club Penguin, and Roblox when I was younger. My entire group of friends were present. I had a large number of buddies. These games actually became a big part of my life. I even forget to eat at times because I was so hooked on these games.  Fast forward to today with all the metaverse projects that have been popping out, I'm curious to see how it all plays out on a personal level and how it compares to my experience in gaming these virtual sims. They are welcome to try to create a platform that I would want to spend any considerable amount of time on in my opinion. But, if the status of social media is any indicator, corporate interests will dominate, and they will not be discreet about it.  To ensure that technology does not go out of hand and that we can live in a world of invention and compassion, a social equilibrium must be established. Well what do you guys think?�143�0
2022-05-12 06:37:25�unusub�So what is everyone planning to do here? Seeing what happened to Luna is worrying me a bit.�So I got into crypto December 2020. I had around 3K, then the first crash happened around April 2021. I lost just over half of my money, I was gutted but didn’t want to sell at such a loss. It eventually went back up, I started adding more money and then I got to just under 7K by mid November 2021, which is when the second big crash happened. I went from just under 7K to around 3.8k. Eventually started going up again, get back to 6.3K and now we are here, 6 mini dips followed by a huge crash again, now I am at around 3.1k.  All the other times I was able to sell, but I staked about 4 months ago so now all I can do is watch. I am in this for the long run, but it does get hard hearing all this bad news, plus the whole Coinbase stock crashing. I’m hoping for some good news at some point, although this has happened 3 times since I started, it’s still just as gut wrenching as the first time. I know Ethereum is much better than all of these shitcoins, but it’s still hard to think positive when a coin loses 20% in a single day.  So, is everyone still holding? Anyone going to sell and re enter when they think it has hit bottom?�7�0

Their support (alongside with Metamask's) has been historically bad, speaking from experience.   Currently considering [argent.xyz](https://argent.xyz) or [Liquality.io](https://liquality.io/) as options. More inclined on moving forward with the latter as it stands (Atomic swaps and UX).

2022-05-13 21:12:49�up1kzf�I am optimistic about the crash�I am sure many have expressed a similar sentiment already, but this crash is going to do a lot of good in the way of cleaning up in the crypto world. The main argument for the adoption of crypto in the financial world comes from the fact it cannot be manipulated in a centralized way.   There is a soundness to crypto that is (supposed to be) based on the ruthless pragmatism of the source code in the chain. But with the rise in popularity of crypto have come a lot of con artist more interested in the hype than the technology underlying crypto. Well, now is the time of reckoning, the storm that will knock down all the poorly built houses, but will also tell us which ones are solid.   Even within Ethereum, it was clear to many that although the defi and NFT features have a lot of potential, the concept was sold before being mature enough. It was like if we discovered the magic of 3D printers and started “printing” all the possessions of our dreams, and now we are realizing your plastic 3D printed lambo can’t actually drive.   This doesn’t mean a lambo will never be 3D printed, but it does mean decoupling our valuation of the technology from reality will ultimately cause disappointment. All this to say that despite the big crash that is starting, I am optimistic because I do think the tech behind some blockchains, especially ETH, have real value and potential.�7�0

2022-05-13 19:53:42�uozw9n�Will Ethereum be able to bounce back from the cryptocurrency crash?�"On Thursday, investors are considering Ethereum (ETH-USD) price predictions as they deal with the continuing crypto meltdown.   Even a significant participant such as Ethereum is susceptible to the crash. In recent days, the cryptocurrency has lost value as a big chunk of the market continues to decline. Ethereum is currently trading at roughly $2,000 per token. Since July 2021, this is the highest pricing.  Investors who are unsure what triggered the cryptocurrency meltdown might blame a variety of factors. The persistent economic pressure is one example. This is due to rising interest rates, rising prices, recession talk, and the Russian-Ukraine conflict.   It's fair that traders are curious about the future of cryptocurrency in the wake of the recent crisis.  According to Marca https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2022/05/13/627dbc03ca47417f7a8b4608.html, The announcement has generated debate over whether the market has reached the projected cooling period, termed ""crypto winter,"" or a longer-term freeze, dubbed ""crypto ice age.""   ""Bitcoin continued to tumble and ended below $30,000 for the first time since July,"" Yuya Hasegawa, a crypto market analyst at Bitbank, wrote in an emailed note viewed by Forbes.   The fact that big players are starting to join the party may offer crypto investors hope.  A regulatory swat might drive even the littlest of cryptocurrencies including Solana which saw a 1400% increase in 2021 before the general crypto decline and Quint which has a large ecosystem comprising of NFTs, NFT marketplace and a superstaking platform; considerably lower, whereas timely choices could maintain any underlying value.   The future appears to be uncertain: either a brief winter respite or an epoch-ending ice age appear to be viable options. There will be no single currency or platform that can endure it."�26�0

2022-05-13 09:00:36�uonhh7�Do you believe that more and more stores, companies, and other entities will begin to accept cryptocurrency payments in the near future?�Have you noticed how crypto payments are increasingly becoming popular methods of payment? This sparked a revolution in the digital payment system and gave an option for those without access to traditional institutions.     What do you think, how long will it take for people to start paying this way on a daily basis?     We can use Unicoins for investing in companies with huge potential, so we may use cryptocurrencies this way as well. It's no wonder that some top stores and brands have decided to accept cryptocurrency as a legal means of payment. This use of crypto is becoming more common among people.     Some big companies and brands that are accepting crypto payments are Microsoft, Wikipedia, PayPal, Starbucks, and UAE's Emirates Airline set to accept Bitcoin as a payment method as well, there are a huge number of these types of examples.     Do you think this will come to life and become popular and new normality in the near future?     Did you have the opportunity to pay something in crypto?�3�0

2022-05-13 07:41:10�uomgxb�Did you ever use blockchain for storing documents, did anyone have any experience with it?�The most significant technical innovation, in my opinion, was blockchain technology, which is essentially a data structure that can be utilized by any organization, not just by cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, blockchain is the best data format for storing and transferring documents since it addresses the basic concerns of openness, privacy, and data integrity.       There's a great explanation on Zenotta's website about how, as the owner of the data, your claim and ownership of the data are based on identification rather than access, thanks to the immutability of the historical record given by their blockchain. It's as easy as that, your keys - your data.       This made me very interested in this subject, so I would like to hear your opinion, what do you think about that?       That implies that we can now keep all of our data on a laptop, whether it's a jpg file, a pdf file, or even a video, using blockchain technology. I love the concept, but I must say that I haven't tried it yet.       If any of you have tried it, please let me know how your experience was.�4�0

2022-05-13 07:21:04�uom7i8�What happens if the NFT game gets shut down? Do you know how this is regulated, and do players receive compensation if something goes wrong?�I was always worried about what would happen if anything like this happened, it would not be a good scenario. We already had that problem when F1 shut down its game, I didn't play it, but I know a lot of people spent a lot of money on digital assets for this game.     So, this implies that customers who paid a lot of money for one of the digital assets are trapped with it in just one game that no longer receives fresh material from the publisher, similar to what occurs with more traditional virtual gaming gear when a game goes down. This may hurt individuals who paid a premium sum for an NFT.     I recall having a plan to check out F1, but thank heavens another NFT game, K4 Rally, blew my mind and completely distracted me just as I found out that F1 was closing down.     And who guarantees that we will get compensation if something similar happens? Do you know how they regulated this and whether this issue was regulated at all?     Is there someone among you who had this problem with some of these NFT games?�2�0
2022-05-13 07:10:09�uom253�What are your thoughts on why Ether whales are transacting such large amounts of ETH these days?�I first thought maybe people started panicking since all these crypto droppings has begun, so they started doing transactions and maybe selling ETH. What do you think, what could be the reason? Do you think that ETH holders are feeling insecure when it comes to these crypto price swings?     Ether whales made a total of 2,956 transactions, each valued at over $1 million on Wednesday, marking the highest day of whale transactions in nearly five months (whales are typically defined as any account holding between $1 million to $10 million).      Did any of you do some recent transactions?     We had so many worries lately, high gas fees, and now all the crypto scene feels insecure, people started using now even more L-2 solutions, I personally rely for months on Metis, and these L2 platforms provide me to feel more secure when it comes to lower gas prices and faster transactions.      I sometimes think it's impossible to work without them, what do you think?     What I've found out in one article about these massive transactions is that Carlos Gomez, chief investment officer at Belobaba crypto hedge fund, said that this type of market activity may mean crypto investors are closer to the bottom of the current market dip than they realize. Do you think that this really means that investors are closer to the bottom?�4�0

I usually avoid buying any VC backed shitcoins like the plague, but unfortunately I didn't do my research and bought LUNA a while ago.

What do I take away from this:  - if you don’t understand how something works down to the bone then come to terms with that risk. It’s ok to take risks….  - avoid projects where the leadership is unknown or have less than desirable views/ideas/incentives/goals/behaviours  Do Kwon came across as an arrogant ass in every interview I watched. It was not subtle. I can think of a few other founders that give me that vibe.  If they can’t discuss their project openly and acknowledge weaknesses or downsides then I’m not on board. Maybe you can’t be out there in the market doing that as a founder though?  Humility, curiosity, integrity and accountability are my checkpoints to jump on board a project - anyone else have any thoughts on this? Might be horrible traits for the necessary pumping of a project I guess….  I can think of a clear example that shows I am wrong in Elon Musk so I’ll cop that. Although he seems like an ass he is operating at a much higher level than almost anyone else and has delivered beyond expectations as far as I can tell.  All opinions are not strongly held so tell me where I am wrong 🤔�6�0

2022-05-14 21:17:25�upqmjd�NFT tickets, yes or no?�You've probably heard how many people are pleased with NFT tickets. I, also, appreciate the concept and support it, and here's why.     Control over secondary market sales may be viewed as one of the most crucial benefits provided by NFT tickets, especially given those ticket resellers continue to buy thousands of event tickets for resale at exorbitant prices.     The most essential thing is to choose the correct platform and my vote goes to NFT TiX as well since, first and foremost, it offers safety and is not complicated, it even looks easy to use, I think that it could really fit me, I will check that out as soon as they start selling tickets. I feel that as time goes on, there will be an increasing number of excellent sites offering NFT tickets.     Other advantages include selling tickets to upcoming events that you are unable to attend, selling rare past tickets that other people would like to acquire, carefully preserving tickets to keep memories alive, participating with and being a part of event organizer communities. This will surely come to fruition when people begin to comprehend its purpose and realize that it will give them huge benefits and security.�0�0

2022-05-14 21:01:33�upqbpw�What do you know about privacy coins?�Hey, guys, what do you know about privacy coins?  I've recently learned about them and what they're used for, but they've confused me a little. What I've found out about them is that privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that preserve users' anonymity by concealing money flow throughout their networks. They make determining who sent what to whom difficult, which is useful if you don't want anyone listening in on your financial dealings.  They are fascinating, to be sure, but why would anybody consider using them when we have all of these data/privacy safeguards like Modex and analogous ones?  I've heard that there are even systems that secure your files, not just smart data, but normal files like jpg, mp4, and so on. So, what's the story behind these coins? Do they merely secure the transportation of your money and have no data protection, for example?  I didn't understand how they function correctly, so it would be great if someone could explain the difference. Are privacy coins truly anonymous? Do they truly do an excellent job?�5�0
2022-05-14 20:35:58�uppu0i�Do you believe Dogecoin will see a huge increase in the near future?�Did you notice that more and more organizations, industries, and websites accept crypto payments?  I am confident that we will begin using these forms of payments very soon. The most recent crypto payment news that I heard was regarding Dogecoin and its ability to be used for payment on WordPress websites.     Cryptocurrencies are absolutely becoming a very essential part of our life, I've heard that we can even invest in Unicorn firms using crypto (through Unicoins) and that we can use crypto to buy food and other items we need on a daily basis, so I anticipate to see more of this sort of news.     Are you using cryptocurrency to invest in something or to buy anything?

2022-05-14 19:12:02�upo5h7�Heard Of Sweatcoin? They Have Now Recorded 100,000 New Users Daily After Launch in April�Since the launch of the SWEAT crypto token on April 12, it has recognized the creation of over 3.4 million wallets through its mobile app.  According to the post made on CoinQuora, this puts the total of allocated sweatcoins at over 860 million, which will be matched with SWEAT at the token generation event in July of 2022.  SWEAT is a token based on the Ethereum Blockchain like Aace, Uniswap, Bobcoin, chainlink, etc., which has done very well. Unlike the others it's a move-to-earn concept which means that users are able to mine the token by tracking their steps on their smartphones.   The company acknowledged that the idea behind the token is to launch a global currency based on the importance of steps and movement. SWEAT will be minted purely by steps.  The Sweatcoin app has seen very positive growth over the last few months. Between May 1 and 4, it saw more than seven million new users.  This puts the total of worldwide sweatcoin used at more than 76 million. The Sweatcoin app even saw a 22% growth rate in one month.  The co-founder of Sweatcoin, Oleg Fomenko, also stated that  Sweatcoin has “seen around 100,000 people sign up every day since our launch. This is already one of the biggest onramps into crypto ever with more and more people buying into the move-to-earn concept.”  Sweatcoin primarily aims to incentivize people to be more healthy. In a report released by the company, they found that people walk on average 20% more after downloading the app.  Will sweatcoin be a pioneer in the move-to-earn crypto space?�0�0
2022-05-14 19:07:52�upo2iw�What do you find most interesting about the gaming industry's growth?�The gaming business has come a long way from the days of arcades. I remember playing Super Mario, then GTA a few years later, which I thought was the height of video gaming at the time with those visuals lol. I could never have envisioned all of these things that we currently have! The gaming business is evolving in terms of improving the game experience.     It has gone a long way in the last several decades. Indeed, the worldwide gaming business is expected to be valued at USD 314.40 billion by 2026, up from USD 173.70 billion in 2020, with a 9.64 percent CAGR between 2021 and 2026. If you ask me, it is a significant distinction.     The majority of the credit belongs to technological innovation. The introduction of VR, AI, and AR, as well as its integration with game consoles such as Xbox and PS5, has transformed the gaming experience into something previously inconceivable.     Blockchain and cryptocurrency are already influencing the gaming industry with innovations and utilities that benefit both gamers and gaming firms. A fresh wave of upheaval is on its way.     With games like K4 rally, the first rally blockchain game, we changed the gaming landscape when it comes to racing/motorsport games; it's no longer about NFS or similar games when we now have these types of games where you can even have direct contact with real rally racers, which I believe is something that people are looking forward to.     What do you find most interesting about the growth of the gaming industry?�4�0

2022-05-14 18:43:02�upnkiv�Do you believe Ethereum has a chance to overtake Bitcoin?�"According to the article I read, Ethereum was formerly regarded as bitcoin's younger sibling. Things have changed since then.     However, due to technical issues with the Ethereum network, users are being forced to pay hefty ""gas costs"" to make transactions. I'm having trouble due to rising petrol prices, and I'm attempting to tackle the problem using Metis and other comparable platforms.     That might change when Ethereum adopts a new standard that supporters think would boost its efficiency. As one may expect, it relates to Ethereum 2.0.     Analysts believe Ethereum is now nearing its transition to proof-of-stake, as well as improvements to gas costs that will benefit its cryptocurrency — even as competing DeFi blockchains close in on it. The switch to proof-of-stake could help improve congestion, which is why experts are optimistic.     The number of transactions is related to the price of gasoline. Smaller transactions could increase as gas prices fall, increasing network utility and driving up pricing.     What are your thoughts on Ethereum's ETH 2.0 switch to proof-of-stake?"�8�0
2022-05-14 18:38:04�upnh02�$1.2 Billion Liquidated in ETH Futures overnight, is this the end?�According to today's headline the Shanghai High People's Court made Bitcoin the largest crypto currency as a virtual property protected by Chinese law. Governments across the  world have struggled to place Bitcoin under existing rules as some Indians said BTC is a gambling. According to the announcement china had a different thought they viewed it as a property and this was a relief to investors. According to reports, it was confirmed that Bitcoin is a virtual property as the Shanghai People's Court, issued a statement on their Official WeChat Channel regarding Bitcoin.  This got many people surprised because the Chinese government has not lifted the ban on crypto trading. During the main trial practice the Shanghai People's Court formed a unified opinion that Bitcoin is a or will be identified as a virtual property and Bitcoin has a noticeable economic value that conforms to the properties attributes. This calls for the Legal rules of property to apply for the protection of Bitcoin.  Everyone observing the confusing behavior of the crypto world and the Chinese government by their harsh banning of Bitcoin and expelling its miners from the country in 2021  got people confused. Recently, data from website traffic metric supplier Similarweb showed that crypto exchanges like Deribit, FaithTribe, OKX and Threedium still get huge traffic from China where the major portion of the participation is from the Decentralized Finance Sector.   Cheng Mou filed a case against Shi MouMou in Shanghai Baoshan District People's Court telling the court to issue an official statement about BBitcoin because Shi MouMou was meant to return a Bitcoin to Cheng Mou in 2020 when none of them agreed to come to an agreement the High court had to intervene.a�5�0

I read a lot of those articles on CNN, BBC and various websites. People apparently lost their homes because of Luna? Really?  I hate to sound rude, but what if that story isn't true. I find it difficult to believe a person's whole life was connected to the price of one coin.   If you had millions of dollars then you must also be smart enough to diversify your portfolio.

Do you think the current crypto decline is here to stay?�"The values of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have fallen in tandem with the crypto market.   The bitcoin meltdown reduced sales volumes for NFTs organizations.   According to Marca.com  https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2022/05/13/627e83d646163f4b108b45e1.html  The Bored Ape Yacht Club collections saw their ""floor pricing,"" which implies they are the lowest priced list of NFTs since their inception.   BAYC collections have plummeted by 25% in the last week.   According to The Block, the current value of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection is 88 ETH (Ethereum) per item.   BAYC NFTs have dropped by about $500,000 in the last three weeks.   During the same time frame, CryptoPunks, another NFT collection, fell by 15%, with pieces selling for 52.5 Ethereum.  On Thursday, the chaos appeared to be extending to Asia, as crypto-related markets fell.   BC Technology Group Ltd., a Hong Kong-listed fintech firm, was down 6.7 percent at the closing. Monex Group Inc., which controls the Japanese marketplaces TradeStation and Coincheck, fell 10% on the day.   Global central banks are tightening monetary policy to battle inflation, and digital tokens are under pressure as investors flee riskier assets.   S&amp;P 500 futures sank 0.8 percent on Thursday, matching declines in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.   Bitcoin and Ethereum were down 4.2 percent and 9 percent, respectively, as of 4:45 p.m. Hong Kong time.  On Thursday, the price of bitcoin decreased to $25,401.29, according to Coin Metrics. This is the first time Bitcoin has fallen below $27,000 since December 26, 2020.   Ether, the second most valuable digital currency, has dropped to as low as $1,704.05 per unit.   The token has fallen below $2,000 for the first time since June 2021. Ether was last trading at $1,937.88, down 8.8 percent.

(2) take on additional risk(s) to maintain your purchasing power; otherwise, you lose your purchasing power to inflation.

2022-05-14 15:29:31�upjlx9�How I Was Able to Get my UST out of Terra at near $1 When the Peg was Significantly Lower and How You (Maybe) Can Too�TL:DR basically, anchor protocol (the main money market on terra) has 1 UST = $1 hard coded into its oracle, so whenever any liquidations happens on anchor, the equivalent of UST is given. For example, if $100 of atom on terra gets liquidated, the person getting liquidated receives 100 UST regardless of the price. By bidding on liquidations, you can essentially get wrapped assets(ethereum, avax, solano, etc) you can bridge out of terra, and take a maybe 5% loss instead of 80% with UST  First and foremost, I just wanted to say the last couple of days have been incredibly stressful for the Terra community in its i entirety, I wanted to say that if anyone needs any help with anything, or just wants to talk, my dms are always open.   Now a little information about liquidations on terra; there are basically 3 protocols: kujira, lighthouse, and terra toolbox. Kujira is by far the most established, and was what I had used but I’m pretty sure the other 2 work as well. Liqudations are first come first serve with the 0% pool being filled before the 1% and 2% and so on, until 30%, which is the absolute max that can be filled. Bids are filled proportionally to your bid size/the total bid size, so if you bid $1,000 and someone bids $100,000, and the pool gets 50% filled, you’d get 50% or $500 of your bid filled   Anyway, here’s my crazy story of how I was able to turn around 11,000 UST into close to $40,000 using the little oracle trick I mentioned above. Basically, my tale started on the morning of may 10th, right as the Luna dump began. People didn’t really believe in the UST peg and the whole market (LUNA in particular) was dumping super hard. The problem was, as LUNA decreased dollar by dollar, more and more BLUNA(bonded Luna that can be used as collateral on anchor protocol) began to become liquidated   Initially, it wasn’t that big of a deal, Luna was being bought up, but soon it began to spiral out of control. I was liquidating some LUNA on kujira, bidding in the 7% out of 30% pools. This was back when UST was in the high 90 cents, there was a lot of UST in the deep end of the liquidation bidding pool, and soon the death spiral began, and more and more bluna was being liquidated. I personally was buying Luna at a discount and then reselling it on astroport, and making a nice profit on it. When the latter pools (20% and over) began to get hit, shit became serious   Since people sold their discounted Luna (by bidding at a x% premium), they were essentially getting an x% profit at once, and this caused a death spiral. At one point, I had bids in the 30% premium (which was the max) get hit. Around then, I’d essentially turned that 11K into 35k. I got greedy and kept going, and Luna kept dumping, until bluna was trading at well >40% from its peg, LUNA.  At that point, I decided to cut my losses and lost 2K, but salvaged around 33K and let it sit on anchor, hoping the peg would restabalize and I’d be able to go to ethereum with my profit. I went to bed, and when I woke up the next day, the peg was chugging around the .8-.9 zone, and even hit .93. After a bit, Luna basically became a penny stock, and this when I decided I need to get the fuck out of terra.  I began looking at all my options, bridging out via ethereum, etc. and that was when I noticed a little something on the kujira dashboard: Beth(which is LIDO’s steth on terra) was trading for 2300~ UST. UST was clearly off peg, and I wondered if I could swap my ust 1:$1 for Beth. People were front running each other in the BETH liquidation pool, and there were even bids in the 0% pool (which is unprofitable af, since 0.5% of all liquidation fees go to kujira token holders) and that was when I noticed something was amiss.  I placed a UST to test things out, and it got partially filled. Moment of truth, I held my breath while I crunched up the numbers, and sure enough, 1 UST = $1. Seemingly, a couple of big UST holders noticed this and we’re bidding in the 0% pool. I went to bed and woke up, and around 1/2 of the bid I placed was somehow filled. I saw the lido tweet about it being unsafe to hold Beth and rushed  to get it off chain. I managed to bridge the sTETH out.  Sadly, the rest of my sTETH bid wasn’t getting filled and the next day (today) I once again, began looking for ways to exit with the rest of my UST. Then, around noon, kujira said it was closing shop, and everyone should sell their KUJI tokens. The way the kujira pool works was they had 0.5% of all liquidated assets available to stakers proportional to their KUJI share. There was a bonding cooldown to stop people from arbitraging and using the pool as a dex, but the team lifted it.   I realized that you could essentially arbitrage kujira, and essentially gain a % of the pool, which if you did repeatedly, meant gaining a lot of Beth. After arbitraging the pool a bit, I gained a good amount of Beth, and I jumped ship as fast as the little bridge could process my transaction. Overall, I made it out pretty unscathed (apart from all the time I spent glued to the terra/ust charts), and turned 11,000 UST into $40K in 3 days, and got it into something that isn’t imploding or printing out trillions every day  If you’ve made it this far, I hope you enjoyed it. It’s really crazy that I’ve made this much without shorting, and was able to get out at 10x the current peg. You probably can as well, as long as there are BASSETS on anchor protocol. Liqudity is drying up, but there’s still a couple 10 million worth of Beth, wasavax, batom and solano, and if you bid in the 0% pools, you might just be able to get your ust swapped for Bassets and maybe take a 5-25% loss from a market dip, vs holding a depreciating stablecoin. If the mods want to see proof, I’d be glad to share my terra/ether wallet with em, and anyone can check any liquidation platform on terra + anchor protocol and see my story checks out. Once again, if anyone wants to talk or has any questions, my dms are open, and maybe anchor wants to give me a bug bounty for noticing this /s�30�0

I was like this might be the best opportunity of my life and I might finally make a life changing amount when this recovers but unfortunately suddenly it went down to $2.7.  I tried to DCA maybe this is the bottom it can’t ago any lower. Today marks the day when Luna is trading under $0 I have lost all of my investment which took my a whole year to be here.    My heart got sinked after looking at my portfolio. This was devastating. That's the dumbest move I have ever made in my crypto journey. Just don't catch the falling knives.

Some sites, such as QuickSwap, are confirmed as compromised.  Sites that have been reported as being at risk of being compromised include DexTools, CoinGecko, EtherScan, and QuickSwap.  Current recommendation is that if you are able to disconnect your wallet from these sites you should do so until the scope and success rate of these attacks is able to be confirmed and contained.  If you receive a request for connection on a site you would not normally expect to see one (ie as your wallet is already showing as connected) please regard it as suspicious and take appropriate precautions.  These attacks are primarily targeting the sites themselves, so it is recommended you check the twitter feeds and other social media channels for the sites you use to confirm any developments.�4�0

2022-05-15 20:44:05�uqf2sh�Would you be interested in buying NFT tickets?�More and more people and industries from various niches are joining the NFT world on a daily basis, but we already know that the music industry, as well as its artists, is participating. Just take a look last year at the famous music event The Brit Awards or this year at Grammys, they involved NFTs in the show!     As a result of such news, I was inspired to look for numerous good music NFT platforms and marketplaces, and as a result, I've come across amazing music NFT ticketing marketplace NFT TiX, which seems so cool, and after doing some research about their payment methods and technology, I think I'd start using that platform as soon as they start selling tickets. Since I was astonished to find how many events are offering these NFT tickets, I began to conduct some research and came across a wealth of information about the benefits that these sorts of tickets provide to fans and so on.     These tickets are such a great thing, I think they had great advantages for people like collectors, including myself, especially when it comes to music collections.      Do you like the idea of this type of ticketing system and would you be interested in buying such tickets?�5�0

2022-05-15 20:35:16�uqew7a�What do you know about blockchain phones?�It didn't take so much time for blockchain technology to evolve and expand to generate several opportunities in healthcare, finance, and the Internet of Things (I must say, I had never heard of this word until a few weeks ago haha), entertainment, and other industries.     Have you heard of The Internet of Things (IoT)?      Well, it's growing in popularity as customers embrace the idea of networked devices that can instantly move and share data. Blockchain cellphones are now part of this sector.     Did you know that we can now buy blockchain phones?     I understand the importance of blockchain in security, and I've learned a lot about Modex, which has been used by many organizations for data protection, so it's no surprise that we can use blockchain in a number of sectors and for a variety of objectives.     I dunno why, but blockchain phones piqued my interest, especially after understanding that they were deliberately built to ensure the safe storage and transmission of crypto. Blockchain device owners may safeguard their cryptocurrencies using an in-built hardware wallet, which works similarly to an offline digital safe, storing and retrieving secret information.     Do you want to own one of these smartphones? Which companies are making these phones?�0�0

2022-05-15 20:16:12�uqei4s�What was the most shocking thing you discovered you could purchase using cryptocurrency?�What do you think about the fact that cryptocurrencies are being used to pay for things like meals at restaurants, hotels, and even schools, among other things? As a consequence, it's not surprising that a well-known fashion business like Gucci would begin accepting cryptocurrency at certain of its outlets in the United States.       It's fascinating that Gucci stores will take, among other digital currencies, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. At first, I assumed it would be Bitcoin or Ethereum.       Can you think this is how the future will look, with an increasing number of people adopting cryptocurrency as a payment method?       Crypto is certainly having an impact on the world, as evidenced by some things that astound me. We may use it to pay for plane tickets, or we can invest Unicoins in firms with high development potential (Unicorns) and profit from them.       Sign up for the BitPay Card, buy restaurant/delivery service gift cards with bitcoin, or pay directly with cryptocurrency to a limited number of restaurants and delivery services that accept cryptocurrencies. Who knows what else we can all pay for using cryptocurrency.       What was the most shocking thing you discovered you could purchase using cryptocurrency? What do you think is the most important advantage of using cryptocurrencies to pay?�4�0
2022-05-15 19:56:01�uqe2s1�Could you please give me a legitimate reason why you don't like NFT games?�I'd want to hear from someone who has a legitimate reason to dislike these NFT games, what's the deal, and what you don't like about them?     I'm wondering because I was astonished by how many people blasted Heart of Chernobyl, the sequel to the first-person shooting game S.T.A.L.K.E.R., which was supposed to be an NFT game but was shelved due to negative response from the gaming community.     Tbh, I'm not a fan of the concept that every feasible game should be an NFT game; there are particular reasons why certain games should not be and why certain games are so much cooler to be NFT games, and I feel that should continue to be the case.     What I don't get are certain annoying comments from people who haven't even tried NFT games, I even checked the comments for this canceled game, and people were spouting gibberish.     Ofc that I still enjoy conventional video games, but my favorite racing game is K4 Rally, which is one of the greatest I've ever played. On my phone, I also play Splinterlands, and I'm always seeking new games and tips. I must single out the thing that really impressed me, it's how the makers of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 responded to their fans and their choice to abandon the idea of making an NFT game due to public opposition.�6�0

2022-05-15 17:34:54�uqb38w�Number of Busted Illegal Crypto Mining Farms in Iran Nears 7,000. Can a comprehensive legal framework effectively address Mining Abuses without crippling Crypto mining?�Iranian authorities have disconnected and dismantled a total of 6,914 crypto farms that were mining without a license. This has been the case since authorities began cracking down on illegal cryptocurrency extraction in 2020, according to the English-language Iranian newspaper Financial Tribune.  According to a report published by Iribnews.ir, these facilities have consumed 645 megawatts of electricity while minting digital currency without authorisation. This is equal to the annual consumption of three major regions: North Khorasan, South Khorasan, and Chaharmahal-Bakhtiari, according to estimates.  After the government adopted legislation for the sector in July 2019, cryptocurrency mining has been a lawful industrial activity in Iran for almost three years. A license framework was implemented, and enterprises interested in getting involved in the company must first get permission from the Ministry of Industries.  In my opinion legislations governing crypto mining are meant to address the excesses of miners making sure that they do not mine at the expense of the electricity provider companies and the environment. Such legislations are meant to promote eco friendly mining system. The typical miner wants to mine at all cost has long has he gets rewards, can't blame anyone that's just human nature.   More and more people are flocking towards innovative  web3 projects that attends to diverse needs such as Decentraland  an online world that allows users to create their own avatars and purchase plots of virtual land, RenderToken is a graphic rendering network that lets miners with excess graphics processing unit bandwidth parcel it out to artists and creative studios that need extra computing power, Minosis token is a deflationary hedge for the Minosis company a cryptocurrency mining company that allows users to join mining pools to earn rewards, provides ning software, and sources mining hardware, Silks a blockchain-based metaverse that enables users to own, trade, and profit from thoroughbred racing horses. As the demand for these projects grows so do the demand for cryptocurrencies has blockchain projects utilize cryptocurrencies for transactions. This in return fuels the need for a growing crypto mining community although some blockchain network now utilize the proof-of-stake consensus which has been said to consume less power I think doesn't diminis the need for mining.   I think legislations should crub the excesses of miners and promote eco friendly mining operations however the laws should not be strict to the extent that they discourage miners by putting in place conditions that are nearly impossible to fulfill and  also changing exorbitant fees.  news source:  https://news.bitcoin.com/number-of-busted-illegal-crypto-mining-farms-in-iran-nears-7000/�1�0

2022-05-15 14:32:53�uq7crn�Seeking advice & informative resources to convince my father, a professional stock trader, to invest in ETH�Hello! I am new to this sub and pretty new to crypto as well. To be honest I probably have a 8% understanding of crypto currencies, the blockchain, virtual wallets - etc.  I’m putting that number so low because the research I’ve been doing has if anything shown me that to be successful at trading ETH one should be very informed and have meaningful understandings of all the different platforms and procedures for buying, storing and diversifying one’s assets.  With all this being said, I am trying to get my dad to better understand the value (and risks involved) of trading ETH because I think if he actually understood it he could be interested in investing in a serious fashion (and possibly give me a loan to invest as well).  My father is a traditional stock trader who mostly deals in IPOs and previously managed a hedge fund with around  100 million in assets. He’s almost 70 years old and started trading in 1998 and made most of his money in the first 3 years. His assets are probably worth around $19 million, mostly in the form of private and one commercial properties.  The point of all of this is to say that he is not afraid to take risks and I think I could convince him to invest at least a few thousand dollars in ETH but I need help convincing him to do so, and so I am asking if anyone has any resources they could share that make understanding the function, history and ultimately value of ETH easier for someone who just found out what NFTs are a month ago.   I hope this post doesn’t sound too naive and I truly appreciate any advice or resources anyone has to share offer .  Cheers, and thank you so much .  TL;DR What are some online resources that could help someone familiar with the stock market but not cryptocurrency understand it and even better encourage them to invest in it , especially at this very moment?�3�0

2022-05-15 13:10:26�uq5swu�Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum explains how we can prevent whales from dominating staking. Do you think whales are affecting the prices of Ethereum?�According to U-Today https://www.google.com/amp/s/u.today/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-explains-how-we-can-prevent-whales-from-dominating-in-staking%3Famp   Many Ethereum (ETH) supporters are worried about the potential centralization of the ETH2 staking process. As a result, they are debating how to prevent the 'oligarchs' from gaining control.  Pseudonymous Ethereum (ETH) enthusiast Superphiz.eth, an activist in the Ethereum Beacon Chain community, has taken to Twitter to express his concerns about the forthcoming ETH2 network's centralization.   Who will be the first staking provider to officially promise to not operating more than 22 percent of the validators on the chain? Who do you want to see step up and put beacon chain health ahead of profits?  He is speculating on which pool will be the first to limit its own staking'power' (share of controlled validators participating in signing Ethereum (ETH) transactions) to, say, 22% of all validators.  This choice may reduce the income of this 'pioneer,' but it will tremendously benefit the network as a whole by minimizing the risk of a 51 percent attack.   Vitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, provided a 'economical' justification for this limit. It appears logical for him to raise costs for staking pool participants who control more than 15% of the network.  Once the'share' of this or that pool falls below 15%, the fees can be adjusted back to'regular' levels.  It should be noted that Ethereum (ETH) - even in its Proof-of-Work (PoW) version - is criticized for 'centralization': huge mining pools control the vast majority of its hashrate.   As previously reported by U.Today, the Cardano (ADA) community encountered similar challenges following the debut of ADA staking. Input Output Global (IOG) gradually adopted a variety of restrictions to make staking through huge pools less profitable. It remains to be seen how the crypto decline will affect coins like Zetrix that has an ecosystem comprising of NFTs; Solana that saw a major rise in value in 2021 and so on.  By modifying the so-called k-parameter in 2021, tiny and medium pools were able to exceed the top ten staking whales in terms of ADA staked.�6�0

2022-05-15 10:28:58�uq39db�Why Ethereum price could fall to $1,000. How deep do you think ETH will fall?�Ethereum price displays a recently established bearish stronghold.   According to FXStreet https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/why-ethereum-price-could-fall-to-1-000-202205142153   On the 2-day chart, Ethereum price has produced a highly lethal-looking bearish engulfing candle. The ETH price is currently trading at $2,000, barely above the settling price of the preceding candle. Early buyers may be surprised in the following days as the price continues to plummet in a freefall pattern towards $1400. If the technicals are true, the Ethereum price might stage a countertrend rally before going below $1,000.   The price of Ethereum has experienced a large surge in negative volume, further complicating the notion of a $1,000 price goal. The bears have left a characteristic ramping pattern on the volume indicator, which can be used to predict future drops. If the technicals are true, a chance to short the ETH price could present itself in the coming days.   A break below $2,660 confirms the bearish downtrend. If the bulls can break over this level, the bearish double zig-zag thesis will be proven false. The bulls could then aim for a $3,000 price target, which would represent a 33% increase over the current Ethereum price.  It is evident that most cryptos follow the rise and drop of the Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s next movement is unknown but is expected to drop. This will affect all cryptos including Solana which saw a major rise in 2021 and Quint which has a relatively large ecosystem. We can only hope for the quick recovery of the crypto markets.�223�0

2022-05-16 23:50:43�ur9h16�How to legit buy ETH at 30-40% discount as long-term HODL�   So I discovered this hack for anyone holding ETH long-term that allows them to earn a pretty decent yield on top of the usual return…  Found it as trying to figure out if there’s any way to “unstake” what I’d locked in staking contract with Guarda before 2.0 launches - discovering they created a workaround by issuing those who’ve staked GETH, which are exchangeable 1:1 when 2.0 finally launches.  And GETH is trading on Uniswap for roughly 35% below current value of ETH.  reason I’m sharing this is because I wanna sell more of my GETH at better prices to move into other investments. So the more people that know and do this, the higher prices I’ll be able to get for mine. Lol.  But for anyone planning to hold ETH until after the merge, swapping your ETH now for GETH and back to ETH after will earn roughly an extra 50% return.  DYOR.  Your welcome. 🥂�0�0

When it comes to more popular ones, I've heard a lot of talk about Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polygon (MATIC). What's your opinion on these 3 cryptocurrencies, will they have a bright future soon?     Since I first became interested in cryptocurrency, I've been curious about these less-popular currencies because I feel that most of them will have their own glorious moment at a certain time. That's why I was given an opportunity to work with Unicoins, the entire concept they represent blew my mind.      Anyway, what are your thoughts on my theory?     Many individuals who start working with crypto imagine the crypto scene as some form of instant moneymaker in which only Ethereum and Bitcoin participate lol (it would be really cool if things work just like that), it's kinda fun hearing their opinions on this issue, but we were all rookies once.

Nexo state that my initial ETH is insured so even if Nexo dies i can't see any risk. I'd be shorting USDT for the cost of the APR %�The repayment amount isn't too far off of a standard business loan, so to my eye it looks like i'm taking a loan out with a small but not insignificant possibility that i could repay it all in 9 months or maybe 2 years for far far less than it was worth when i took out, if Tether crashes and burns. As Tether is pegged to $1 when functioning normally there is no risk i'd have to pay back more (other than US inflation).  Also i'd be retaining my initial tokens in an exchange which guarantees they are insured by a third party just in case the Tether crash takes them down too.  Can anyone see a fault in the logic here?  Could they refuse to take my repayment in Tether if the price crashed?  Or i guess if Nexo also crashed perhaps that insurance wouldn't pay out until after a long legal battle?  It seems like i'd be in essence shorting Tether�3�0

2022-05-16 13:52:22�uqwh7i�14 reasons you don’t own enough Ethereum.�> Stablecoins  Stablecoins are crypto’s killer app.  They act as a hedge against volatility & allow users to “cash out” without ever leaving the ecosystem.  As of today, the total stablecoin market cap is $180B.   Nearly 75% of which are home to Ethereum.      &#x200B;  > DeFi  Ethereum allows anyone with an internet connection to conduct their finances in a trust-less manner.  In DeFi, you will never cross paths with another bank or middleman.  The implications of this cannot be understated.   &#x200B;  > Developers  Ethereum is top dog when it comes to developers.  No other blockchain comes close.   It is estimated that Ethereum has over 4,000 monthly active developers, while Bitcoin has approximately 680.   &#x200B;  > NFTs  In 2021, we witnessed a Cambrian Explosion of NFTs.  Fortune 500 companies, celebrities, & institutions all wanted to take part in this new tech.  However, we have still barely scratched the surface, & this sector is expected to grow significantly as more utility is added.   &#x200B;  > dApps  Every day, dozens of new protocols launch with the goal of furthering Ethereum’s use cases.  As of today, there are more than 3k dApps & 200k ERC20 tokens on Ethereum.  Whether directly or indirectly, each of these bring value back to Ethereum.   &#x200B;  > DAOs  DAOs offer a new way to govern organizations.  Rather than rely on a board of directors to make executive decisions, DAOs are governed by the organization’s members and enforced by code.  DAOs are the future of governance.   &#x200B;  > Layer 2s  Ethereum has a war chest of developers building out protocols that will help it scale.  These protocols are light years ahead in research compared to ETH’s competitors and achieve scale without sacrificing decentralization in the process.    >   >   >   > The Merge  Ethereum’s merge will rid the network of its Proof of Work algorithm that is bad for the environment and mark the era of eco-friendly Ethereum.  It is estimated that Ethereum will consume 99.5% less energy under proof of stake.   &#x200B;  > Sharding  Sharding is one of the most important upgrades to Ethereum.  With sharding, the Ethereum blockchain will be split into 64 “shards”.  This will significantly reduce the hardware requirements to run a node, increase TPS of Ethereum & reduce network congestion.   &#x200B;  > Triple Halving  Ethereum is set to go through a massive supply shock following the merge, and could prove to be deflationary.  This event is commonly referred to as the “Triple Halving”, where Ethereum will undergo a supply shock equivalent to 3 BTC halvings in 12 months alone.   &#x200B;  > User Growth  The number of unique addresses on Ethereum has been nothing but a straight line up since its inception.  New users will continue to stockpile in as more products and use cases are built out on Ethereum.   &#x200B;  > Staking  The ETH 2.0 deposit contract has amassed 12.5M ETH.  After the merge, tx fees will go to validators who stake their ETH.  Attracted by the APY, users will continue to rush in to stake their ETH.  It is not unlikely we see a considerate amount of ETH’s supply staked.   &#x200B;  > \-26% of [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) locked in smart contracts -$116B TVL in DeFi -5.5% of [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) staked -EIP-1559 on pace to burn $4.5B worth of [$ETH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click) this year -liquidity pools -exchange balances reaching 3 year lows   &#x200B;  Credit goes to [https://twitter.com/PastryEth](https://twitter.com/PastryEth)�4�0

2022-05-16 13:28:50�uqvzvr�Stack free crypto in these trying times� I’m sure many of you out there with huge balls are still out there giga-braining and scalping this shit, but for most of you that aren’t and are having urges to “buy the bottom,” one thing you can try are crypto-earning activities (if you haven’t already used them all). Here’s a list of a few just to give an idea  1. **Sator** (probably my favourite): I started off my crypto journey earning crypto through learning. Admittedly it was boring as hell sometimes (fine, most times), I got some good gains out of it. Instead of teaching, Sator rewards you in their own native token, $SAO, for answering trivia questions of popular TV shows and movies, hence their slogan #Watch2Earn. They have Netflix and HBO shows, and even the newest Spiderman a little after it released. Regardless of the price, I do think it’s the safest + most enjoyable way to stack a little in these trying times. 2. **Rabbithole**: This one kind of took me a while to learn how to use, but it was smooth sailing afterwards. One reason I like this one is because they not only teach you a lot, but they do it through more hands-on type learning and having you actually participate in DAOs, minting NFTs, and etc. They have a lot of different and smaller projects/ecosystems in there, and I think it’s great to get people to see more of what’s out there than the “bluechip” projects. Also I like the aesthetic. 3. **Binance, CoinMarketCap, Coinbase** \+ other Learn & Earns: The best part of these? You can stack LUNA!!! Ermmm… All jokes aside, these are extremely good resources for beginners. It shows you the biggest projects “bluechip” (at least at one point), and you know that what you’re learning is legit. The downside is it’s boring unless you love to learn or are fascinated by every aspect of crypto. You watch videos, read, and take a quiz. Imagine school, but your reward can possibly be sold for a lot of money at some point, or worth nothing forever, which in that case, is pretty much just school for you.  These are relatively simple projects out there that I’m sure many of you already know, especially the traditional Learn and Earns, and might think are worth nothing. However, I think it’s important to be reminded to go back to basics and not to be too overzealous in times like these. Desperate times call for desperate measures.�59�0

2022-05-16 11:42:49�uqtyyo�What's the lamest P2E game you've ever played?�The primary value proposition for P2E games is entertainment, with earnings as a desirable side benefit, well, that's how I look at these blockchain games which I started to enjoy more and more. How about you? What would you say it's the best thing about them?     As I've found, P2E games often rely on their player population expanding over time. Players are likely to stick with these games for one of two reasons: the gameplay is fantastic and keeps your attention to the maximum (K4 Rally in my case) or the income is consistent and good. Given the number of players each month, I would say that most of these games provide both of the reasons I stated.     Are there any of these games that disappointed you with lame incomes or lame gameplay?      I've heard a lot of people complain about Axie Infinity cause of a too slow increase in Axie supply and Axie prices are too high for everyday people to join. I didn't play it so I'm not compatible to talk about it, so, you who play it, what do you think about it, is it true?�5�0
2022-05-16 11:42:42�uqtywc�Why is EVM being used now?�" I think EVM's are now a must since it is at the heart of everything that’s happening in the cryptosphere. Blockchain developers appreciate them since they do not have long downtimes and can protect developed application objects from being updated or altered.         The two most important benefits of post-Ethereum blockchains are increased speed and decreased transaction costs. A third benefit of EVM support is full interoperability with the world's largest smart contract network. Users may now enjoy the familiarity of Ethereum and its family of services — decentralized exchanges, portfolio trackers, and wallets – while still benefiting from the speed and cheap fees of younger networks.        From a short glance at this [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2022/05/12/will-ethereums-virtual-machine-eat-itself/?sh=76ea3d335902), even old chains are taking a fresh look at EVM. Polkadot and Cardano, for example, have founders who can be traced back to Ethereum. Also moving towards a less antagonistic stance towards Ethereum are the ""OGs"" of the blockchain world - Qtum and EOS."�113�0

2022-05-16 10:03:48�uqsehj�Will the Ethereum 2.0 update reduce high gas fees?�This topic is becoming more and more popular as the Ethereum merge is coming closer and closer. I was wondering is this even possible, does the merge have anything with it or not.     The primary goal of the Ethereum 2.0 update is to improve scalability so that the network can handle more transactions without delays or high fees.      Because of the high gas fees, people are using all types of solutions, L2 mostly, Metis, Loopering, and who knows what, we have that luck that we can choose now.      Do you think that the blockchain network's popularity is expected to grow once Ethereum 2.0 is released?      One of the most annoying issues, as I must point out, is scalability, which has always been one of Ethereum's major concerns. This is especially true for blockchain developers looking to construct DApps and DeFi platforms, as transaction fees might be prohibitively expensive.     With the release of Ethereum 2.0, it will be feasible to grow the network in a way that decreases costs and allows for speedier transactions. Do you believe there will be a substantial difference?�0�0

2022-05-17 21:23:32�urwrqj�DAO for tv/movie production�Is there any interest in a DAO to fund tv/movie ideas? Members would vote on ideas to be written into scripts and then sold to studios, OR with enough in the treasury, could pay to produce it ourselves. Would be like a decentralized Netflix.   A pilot for a show only costs about $100k-$200k to make, and even before producing the pilots directly, the DAO could make a return by funding scripts and then selling them, and reinvesting the funds into other scripts or pilots. It could also be a cool way to fund independent film makers and breakout talent.   The idea is obviously not fully flushed out but if anyone is interested in discussing this further, DM me!  Edit:  There have been some comments on the feasibility of the quoted cost above. I don’t want this thread to turn into arguments over how much it costs to make a pilot, and I think many of the comments below are coming from a US-centric frame of reference, and not considering costs of production using local teams in places like Thailand, etc… But I acknowledge that my initial guess could be way off in general, and is certainly way off for using any major US/Hollywood or similar crews.   The point of this post is not to put forward a perfect idea, but to see if there are like minded individuals who are interested in discussing different ways to restructure existing systems in ways that could benefit us all. If you have an idea or an interest, please share. If you have no interest in contributing beyond saying that the estimated cost is wrong, please know that I recognize that and you can save your time. If you’re here just to take out your frustrations by name-calling, I’m sorry your life sucks and I hope you find a way to address that productively.�9�0

2022-05-17 20:10:58�urv68m�Are we seeing the potential rise of ETH? Maybe even breaking the $5k barrier?�Overnight, unfavorable risk factors for Ethereum decreased dramatically. The most major event was Turkey's veto of Sweden and Finland joining NATO, which will delay their membership for at least a year, thereby eliminating the prospect of Russian reprisal. After a fresh EU sanctions package was offered, Hungary vetoed any combined EU oil embargoes against Russia, which was a second fuse that was defused. This will make it hard for the EU to impose further measures before the end of the summer.     While a result, the price of ETH has two important tail risks that have already been deferred for several months, allowing risk assets to gain as the US dollar weakens. Expect a 25% rise this week to $2,682.70, but as a time frame of many months has opened with only upside possibilities, a rally to $4,951.83 appears feasible. As the demand for ETH grows, expect a major lack of supply. Is this hinting that ETH-based initiatives such as NFT communities like High Sloth Society, BAYC, and others will be driven high by the rise of ETH?     Retaliation by Russia against Finland and Sweden poses a concern since they are now exposed by their pledge to join NATO, while they cannot depend on NATO's assistance due to Turkey's opposition. A military escalation in the North may pose a huge danger to the markets, causing the dollar to surge to parity versus the euro, causing another selloff in cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum likely to plummet to $1,688.39. Another danger that might drive the price of ETH to $1,400 is if the Federal Reserve hikes rates even more hawkishly and fast, frightening investors away from risk assets.�3�0

2022-05-17 18:31:25�urt00m�Can the Ethereum price remain stable as Vitalik Buterin sells 30,000 ETH? How long do you think the general drop in cryptocurrencies will take?�"Vitalik Buterin withdrew 30,000 ETH from his public wallet today, fueling investor skepticism. Proponents anticipate that the sale of 30,000 ETH by Buterin will have a negative impact on the Ether price.  The co-founder of Ethereum has alarmed investors by transferring 30,000 ETH tokens from one of his multisig wallets. Buterin has previously used the destination wallet to make sales, gifts, and charitable donations.  Buterin's multisig wallet ""Vb 3"" noted a 30,000 ETH transfer to an unidentified wallet.  The public wallet address now holds 290,000 ETH, which is interpreted as a bearish move or as Vitalik Buterin cashing out his Ethereum. While simply transferring a cryptocurrency from one wallet to another is not considered an indicator, Buterin's transfer is out of his Ethereum holdings.   Proponents believe he may wish to sell a portion of the 30,000 ETH.  Ethereum is currently trading at around $2,086. At this rate, the transferred ETH is worth approximately $62.58 million. If these tokens are listed on an exchange, there may be a significant increase in selling pressure on the altcoin, causing prices to fall.   Even though the token has retraced more than 50% of its all-time high, John Roque, an analyst at 22V Research, believes Ethereum remains bearish. According to Roque,  The analyst believes Ethereum price could plummet another 80% from the current price levels and target $420.   The truth is there is almost no crypto including those with large ecosystems like Solana which saw major rise in value in 2021 and Exeno whose ecosystem including access to NFTs and a staking platform; unaffected by the current bitcoin drop. Bitcoin has seen a major drop from 68,000 to 25,000 before it climbed back to 30,000."�64�0

2022-05-17 14:28:17�urnp2c�Should we let Facebook/Meta rule the Metaverse?�Even though I'm surprised and proud of tech development and all the possibilities, I'm also concerned about the metaverse, since the metaverse may someday come to determine how we work, study, and socialize, which is maybe a little too much if you ask me. What are your thoughts about it?     All of this points to VR and AR moving beyond their current specialized applications and becoming everyday technology on which we will all rely.     We may infer Facebook's vision for the metaverse by examining its current approach to social media. It has transformed our online lives into a massive cash stream centered on power, control, and surveillance, all fueled by our data.     Do you honestly trust that your data and privacy will be protected there?     I was wondering whether we might tackle this problem using one of the various blockchain tools and platforms that we now have. I mean, just as Modex blockchain is used by many large companies for data and privacy protection, would it be possible for us, average users, to be protected in Metaverse using these platforms?     What's really disturbing about this is that the way you move your body is so distinctive that VR data may be used to identify you, much like a fingerprint. That means that anything you do in VR might possibly be linked to your personal identity. It's a tempting possibility for Facebook, a digital advertising empire founded on collecting our data.     Must admit that I'm not a huge fan of this idea, how about you?�1�0

2022-05-17 13:16:44�urm8q7�Is it possible for cryptocurrencies to replace cash?�"First of all, I know that this has been discussed so many times and that many analytics said that's not gonna happen like never ever, but here's why I started thinking this way...  Remember that one of the explanations, why crypto's not ever gonna be used as regular money, was mostly ""people don't even use them to pay for things and mostly treat them like stocks-buying them up and selling them at a future profit when the time is right"", well, well, well, what do we have now?  Crypto is being used in many restaurants, hotels, and airlines, for purchasing high fashion clothes, Unicoins for investing in Unicorn companies, WordPress websites using Dogecoin payments, famous people promote crypto, and even the famous Los Angeles Lakers  Staples Center is no longer Staple center but rather the Crypto.com Arena.  So, do we really treat crypto like stocks? Nah, I don't think so, that's something we did in past, but things are way different now. So, it wouldn't be a surprise that in the future cryptocurrencies really replace cash, that's my personal opinion.  What do you think about that, can you imagine that we may use cryptocurrencies for groceries, bills, and regular stuff?  Believe me, I know that in that case it will require HUGE effort for the world to adapt and I'm aware of what I'm talking about. I even know that most people are not even familiar with crypto and all these terms, even though there are people who don't use or can't afford computers, phones, etc. But what if...?"�7�0

Is the lower issuance in POS itself beneficial for decentralization? On the one hand, the less redistribution of coins you have, the less there will be centralizing forces. On the other hand, in POW miners are forced to sell most of their rewards back into the market to pay for energy and hardware, which improves the distribution within the system.  Can you share your thoughts on this? Is the lower issuance in POS good, net neutral or bad for decentralization?�1�0

A total of 1,020,000 Donuts are issued, according to the following breakdown:  * 67% to posters based on donut-upvote w/ quadratic ranking of donut-upvoter (tipper) * 33% to donut-upvoters (tippers)  The tag under *contributor\_type* indicates either `donut_upvoter` for reward total based on tips given or `quad_rank` for the reward total based on tips received.

2022-05-17 01:35:46�urbepn�[Poll Proposal] Burn Un-Distributed Donuts Every 6 Month�Since we have moved distribution entirely to Gnosis chain, we save on gas by minting and bridging 20,400,000 Donuts (6 months worth) at one time. In a perfect world, all these Donuts would be distributed in their entirety every six months. However, in reality, some Donuts never get issued as users are removed from distributions by Reddit for being permanently banned or are left over if the distribution rate is reduced. There are also two new proposals currently live ([here](https://redd.it/uracb5) and [here](https://redd.it/urajxf)) that would further reduce the distribution quantities without actually addressing the donuts that are left over.    While these Donuts have been minted, they were never intended to accumulate. This proposal would address this unplanned inflation by creating a burn mechanism to remove these undistributed donuts from circulation.    ## Specifications - Every six months, when we mint and bridge a fresh batch of Donuts, any Donuts left over from the previous batch will be burned. - This only applies to undistributed Donuts,  not those earmarked for the Treasury or Community Fund.    ## Poll Options The poll options would be:  **[Yes]** - Burn undistributed Donuts every 6 months.  **[No]** - Keep all undistributed Donuts in the Community Fund.    &#x200B; ---  _This governance poll proposal will remain up for a minimum of 2 days per the [governance guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance). This proposal requires sign off from 2 moderators to proceed to a full governance poll._�9�0

This proposal seeks to address this by formalizing the process for removing banned users from earning donuts during the distribution period(s) in which they are banned.    ## Motivation & Process  - Users who have been temporarily or permanently banned from participating in r/Ethtrader have broken some sub rule and should not earn donuts as a result of bad-acting.    ## Specification - Prior to issuing donuts, the list of users banned during that distribution period will be removed from the list of eligible users. - Donuts earned by banned users will be removed from the distribution AND not issued.  - This applies to bans of all durations. In other words, if a users receives a 7 day ban they will earn 0 donuts for the one distribution period in which they are banned. If a user receives a 30 day ban, they will receive 0 donuts for the two distributions period in which they are banned.  &#x200B; [VIEW POLL PROPOSAL DISCUSSION](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/un9g36/poll_proposal_remove_banned_users_from_donut/) &#x200B;  ## Poll Options   The poll options would be:  **[Yes]** - Remove banned users from donut distributions.  **[No]** - Keep the status quo.   &#x200B;   **LINK TO VOTE ON SNAPSHOT: https://snapshot.org/#/ethtraderdao.eth/proposal/0x5b6e7b4975c5902b2a7a8a9196c2db652dc9107c580a518cb9ba6a409bdd4919** &#x200B;  ---  _This governance poll will remain up for a minimum of 5 days per [governance guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance).

This fee would disincentivize spammers by causing them to sacrifice a large portion of any rewards they earn without putting undue burden on normal and productive sub members.   ## Specification * Each post will incur a fee of **250 Donuts** * At the end of each distribution, the total number of posts made by each registered user will be tallied and the total fee will be deducted from any earnings received. * In order to ensure that spammers don't cheat by deleting old posts, the Automod will create a record of each post/poster for the purpose of tallying fees. * Deducted donuts will be removed from the distribution and will **NOT** be issued. * After fee is taken out of the distribution, the amount mods earn will be recalculated based on the reduced distribution amount. * This fee will apply to all posts, regardless of flair type. * This fee will **NOT** apply to r/Ethtrader members who are **NOT** registered to receive Donut distributions. * The fee can be adjusted in the future through a governance poll.  &#x200B; [VIEW POLL PROPOSAL DISCUSSION](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/un9epy/poll_proposal_pay_to_post_for_donut_registered/) &#x200B;  ## Poll Options   The poll options would be:  **\[Yes\]** \- Users earning donuts should pay a reasonable fee to post content.  **\[No\]** \- Keep posting free for all users.  &#x200B;   **LINK TO VOTE ON SNAPSHOT: https://snapshot.org/#/ethtraderdao.eth/proposal/0xd2661bf095517abfd6134bab060264e1e810793e058f981619d55c8a939327e5** &#x200B;  --- _This governance poll will remain up for a minimum of 5 days per [governance guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance).

I'm asking, not trying to impose anything, just wanting to hear different opinions.        Will Bitcoin break through that $30k-ish barrier and rise again? Or is this just a discount for the smart investors?        ETH is still staying around $2000, but there are a lot of ETH based projects that are there to keep it the biggest ""altcoin"" for a long time. High Sloth Society caught my eye these days, as I've missed the BAYC mint a while ago. NFTs are still something that still needs to be developed.       I'm seeing the charts bleeding as I'm writing this, but my question is why? With so many factors affecting the market, I can't accept that LUNA has played any role what so ever.

After hours, the firm transforms into a hacktivist group, causing havoc on the Russian Internet.       The Russian invasion transformed Ukraine, a 44-million-strong country, into a battleground, pushing residents to take up guns to defend their homes – and assembling a global cyber army of hackers to oppose Russia's digital retaliation. Among them are Hacken's 70 employees, who are combining cybersecurity work, ground assistance for fellow Ukrainians, and cyber-attacks against Russia.       The current unrest in Ukraine has alarmed many people across the world, including bitcoin fans.

Now with crypto in a serious downward trajectory and profits diminishing day in and day out with no end in sight I want to know which crypto markets you are using and what the differences are between some of them. Also would like to know if it would make a difference if I switch to a new one, if some of them have benefits that the others don't.     I've been on Binance since day one but this crisis has gotten me searching for alternatives that could maybe give me an advantage.     Now I've done my research and found there are a number of markets that seem respectable like Coinbase, Coinmarketcap, Dura-fi, but would like to hear your opinions on them or any others that might be trustworthy.   Have you had any experience with any of the mentioned or do you have any others to recommend.     Looking forward to your answers.�3�0

Do you know something more about it maybe?     According to what I've discovered, it's a type of data stealer that targets non-custodial crypto wallets (hot wallets). I can't believe how coincidental it is because I was just reading yesterday about how many individuals started using some blockchain data protection, such as we have Modex for major corporations, people started adopting these solutions for personal privacy and data.     Which one would you recommend to me?     I was surprised to find out that cryware allows attackers to instantly move the target’s cryptocurrency to their own wallets after gaining access to their hot wallet data.      Blockchain transactions are final even if performed without a user’s agreement or knowledge. Unlike credit cards and other financial transactions, there are no methods to reverse or protect consumers against fraudulent crypto transactions.       Does that mean that these blockchain solutions could not help us with this issue or I didn't understand this well?"�2�0

2022-05-18 11:38:28�usatqm�Do you think it is possible that many developers will switch from Ethereum to another blockchain cause of the often high gas fees problem?�"GameFi uses blockchain and associated technologies like NFTs and cryptocurrencies to enable players to earn real-world rewards that can be swapped for real-world money. In other words, the long-held gamer idea of earning money from computer games has finally come true.     Players compete for rewards in these games, which may be cryptocurrencies or NFTs that represent in-game commodities like firearms, participant ""skins,"" or car components, as in the upcoming game K4 Rally.     It's all so great because these rewards can be swapped for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens on third-party exchanges, giving gamers an opportunity to cash out and pay for their gaming efforts.     The bulk of crypto video games is created on the Ethereum blockchain due to its first-mover advantage. As the first blockchain with adequate contract capabilities, Ethereum has attracted hundreds of decentralized apps as well as large development and consumer community.     However, developers are experiencing issues with high gas prices (as usual) that clients pay on every transaction, and these transactions can normally take several hours to complete. So, what do you think is the best option here?     I seriously doubt that many developers will switch from Ethereum to another blockchain. What is your prediction?"�1�0

2022-05-18 11:19:31�usain6�What do you think, how long will this dropping trend last?�What do you think of the latest L1 Ethereum network fees that drop to levels which were not seen in over 2 months?     I couldn't believe it when I saw that Ethereum network fees have slid under $10 per transaction, which is great! I dunno what you use when it comes to L2 solutions but you've probably seen on every one of them that has been some serious drop these days.     What's the reason why is this happening? Does anyone know?     Since May 12, L2 costs have dropped significantly in the previous five days. For example, using the Metis Network costs about $0.02 for each transfer and about $0.10 to swap tokens.      While Metis is the most affordable L2, Loopring transfer costs are $0.03 per ether transfer, and token exchanging via Loopring will cost roughly $0.52.     What do you think, how long will this dropping trend last?�0�0

2022-05-18 06:15:54�us6cye�Where can I stake ETH and earn high APY?�My three ETH are currently sitting on an exchange (Coinbase) and right now these are my choices for transferring them:  [Haru Invest](https://haruinvest.com/)  They offer APR for their Earn Plus is 13% with stable daily interest payments making them some of the highest yields on the market. Withdrawal is possible with no additional fees. What’s great about them is that they don’t use a lending-borrowing model which (Celsius and Nexo use).  [Rocketpool](https://rocketpool.net/)  A staking pool. The pool you sent your eth to accumulates over time, their rEth token naturally increases in ratio to Eth. I can buy rEth on Uniswap at L1/L2 or mint fresh rEth for Eth on the rocketpool.net website.  [Nexo](https://nexo.io/)  I like their interest rate and the interface.They offer 8% APY on ETH (and BTC). Interest is paid daily with no fees on withdrawals. They have a rewards system for their APY and even have their own Nexo Token.  [Celsius](https://celsius.network/)  They offer 7.87% APY on BTC as of this writing. They use their holdings to lend to institutions and individuals. You can also trade with Celcius you can do this by buying coins in Coinbase and then transfer to your Celsius wallet.  What do you guys think? Where can I stake it to have good APY?�155�0

The pay2post poll sounds promising but I’m afraid the spammers will start targeting the daily thread.    I propose the minimum account karma be no less than 500 and minimum account age be 1 month.    Most spammers I see have less karma than the proposed amount.  The 1 month account age requirement would stop those who use free karma subs from achieving the 500 karma minimum in a couple hours.  It would also help stop alt account upvotes/downvotes.  These thresholds can be lowered or raised as the community sees fit.  #EDIT 5/18/2022 7:30pm US Central Time:  • The reason for this change to the proposal is to protect genuine newcomer’s ability to interact in r/ethtrader.  **Minimum account age and account post karma thresholds will only be required to start earning donuts.**  • Most of the major spammers/bots responsible for taking half of the last distribution have high comment karma but low post karma, and have an account less than 60 days old.  **For this reason the thresholds will be changed to 1000 post karma and a minimum account age of 60 days.** *With an additional clause that these thresholds may be subject to change at discretion of the moderators*, so that we won’t need a completely new governance proposal to restructure the minimum account age/post karma requirements.    Poll Options would be:   [YES] Institute post karma and account age thresholds   [NO] Keep current rules�64�0

I couldn't help myself. Some of the stuff you find around the web is hilarious and too good not to share. But that's over with. The new norm appears to be people sharing news / media articles with links. All I see are links top to bottom. I don't want to be the guy just reading a headline but I am not clicking links on Reddit so I try to find the article elsewhere. I have shared my concern.   This post is attempting to contribute to the posting dilemma in this sub. Not be a critic. We have improved imo but be weary of what you links you click.  Thanks for your time.�1�0
